"We do NOT have strong leadership. Biden is mentally incompetent. He has opened the borders to up to 52 million illegals, because Obama hates white Christian Americans. He is compromised by Hunter's connections to China. He has Alzheimers. MSM is supporting him in everything he does and brazenly covering up his illegal activities, especially transporting the illegals, many of whom are most likely criminals, throughout the country and without medical proof that they are not bringing virulent diseases into the country. They are NOT being vaccinated while many Americans are losing their jobs because they should have a right to refuse the vaccinations (which are not approved, but only have extended EUAs) and for which we have no clue about the serious long- and short-term side effects). Illegal immigrants, under the guise of ""refugees"" which they are NOT by legal standards, are receiving EVERYTHING for free while Americans are going without homes, food, health care and other basic needs. CRT is being forced on children to ensure they become radicalized. White people have NO rights at all. I believe in equal rights for all, but that is NOT the case since Biden admin was INSTALLED. Heating costs for my home will increase by over 50% alone this winter. Food is NOT affordable and becoming more expensive every day. Just the basics are more difficult and out of reach, let alone the luxuries like hotels and other perks the illegals are getting through our taxes. By the way, those are increasing for us, and it was just confirmed that the RICH will NOT have to pay, even though that is one of the first things that Biden promised to do. One of his promises that he did follow through on, was inviting mooching disease-carrying illegals into the country and force us to pay for them, when many of us cannot afford to feed ourselves and heat our homes. Electricity is through the roof. In my state of Maine, we are paying the highest taxes in the country and most expensive electric bills already. Many of us cannot afford health care. Dems are doing exactly what they want, printing money that future generations could NEVER pay back, putting up TRILLIONS UPON TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN DEBT, all because he, Obama, and Clinton want desperately to destroy the country and turn it into a black muslim country.

democracy is where the people can directly vote on the laws (what the late Senator Mike Gravel advocated for in his book The Failure of Representative Government and the Solution: A LEGISLATURE OF THE PEOPLE). democracy is also where none of the above can win an election so it forces a new batch of candidates until someone wins. democracy has everything (except serious stuff like the nuclear launch codes) declassified and makes it a federal offense to classify a document because of embarrassment/political reasons. democracy is where people like Julian Assange is hailed as a hero instead of dying in prison from a multinational conspiracy to stop him any means necessary (Hillary Clinton even wanted to drone strike him and was talked out of doing it). democracy is where experts in the scientific/environmental field are treated with higher authority then oil companies. democracy doesnt exist in the world and has never existed.,0,1,0
