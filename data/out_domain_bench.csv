This movie is by far the best of the series. It is far more cerebral and in that respect may not please those looking for action or a lot of gore.

"Look at me daddy! I'm a six foot elf!
This movie was supposed to be a good holiday movie and I watched it actually right around Christmas and expected to enjoy it. Boy, I really didn't. Personally, it was one of my least favorite movies I've ever seen. The plot is simple and cute, being about a human that's adopted as a baby by Santa Claus to work with other elves. But when this human realizes that he's different, Santa sends him to the real world to find his real dad. Sure, it sounds cute and everything but I found it to be just terrible. It delivered no laughs and was just way too babyish and weird. I like Will Ferell on Saturday Night Live and in Anchorman but not in childish stuff like this.

"One shot deal (hopefully)
On one hand beautiful scenery and Stapleton's (et al) acting make this film bearable. On the other hand, the story is basically a modernized mishmash of past movies and offers very little originality to the viewer. If you know people involved or have absolutely nothing better to do then this film will help pass time. Otherwise you'll find much better and original both in the theater and on DVD release.Philip Chidel obviously learned something about directing before making this film (hence the two stars), let's hope that he can do the same with his writing before his next attempt.

I bought this CD because it was on sale, and it seemed like a good deal.

This movie was supposed to be a good holiday movie and I watched it actually right around Christmas and expected to enjoy it. Boy, I really didn't.

This was the second time that I bought this model. The first one I bought held up for a long time, so when the pedal broke off I had no complaints.

The bad guys sneak up in an old sub, keeping it at 3 knots (quiet). They get within 3 miles. How?? The task force has a defending screen - use sonar! They have 2 SSNs - use sonar! Dumb. I quit the book at that point. He supposedly had naval advisers. I don't think they earned their pay.

Even at the tender age of sixteen, Uma Thurman has the good sense not to appear very much in this death-rattle of a teen flick.

Isabel Allende tiene una forma unica y peculiar de escribir. Me gustan mucho sus libros, pero tiene un problema: da demasiados detalles y se sale de la trama. Esta era una fantastica historia, sin embargo, no le dio la importancia que debio darle al personaje. Se intereso mas en describir la vida en chile y otras cosas que le restaban importancia a lo que verdaderamente la tenia: la historia de Eliza.

"Another Excellent Thermaltake PSU!
I bought this PSU in a pinch when building my new system. I had bought an OCZ ModXStream PSU for my new system back in May or June and when I got it all together I realized the OCZ PSU was DOA(dead on arrival). Big bummer, so I went on Amazon and purchased the other PSU I was looking into, this Thermaltake(being a previous ThermalTake user, I know its good stuff). Paid for overnight shipping, and was well worth it. Plugged it in and works great. Rails are very accurate and rock solid even under heavy load and overclocking. Build quality is top notch and the smokey plated casing looks great in any case. I am now using this PSU in my multi-track recording system and put the higher capacity OCZ that was sent as my replacement back in my gaming computer.

"An attack on masculinity disguised as an attack on logic
Although it may not be immediately evident, the real theme of this book is to discredit rational and logical thought processes by linking them with Hitler via Weininger and Wittgenstein. The idea is that masculinity is essentially evil and leads to all sorts of horrors such as rational and logical thinking, which somehow lead to the Holocaust. This discourse is part of a much larger one in which science is the ultimate bugaboo. This sort of thing goes at least as far back as the Romantics (""ye murder to dissect""), but in this case is mixed in with the idea that gay men and women are on the side of illogic and unreason, and are therefore the good guys in the war against linear thinking of any sort, which is seen as a product of male heterosexuality.

It took me a horrifically long time to finish this book, and not because I didn't like it! The author leaves absolutely nothing unexplored. Postively everything that goes on in that castle is recorded in extreme detail. The pace is maddeningly slow, but surprisingly, all those little details are delicious. I was fascinated by all the characters, particularly the king and his batty companion Havelock. You spend much of the book trying to figure out everyone's motives, and just exactly whom is allied with whom. The magic of this book is done entirely through glass, which was unusual and refreshing but lost me in some of the technical explanations. Geraden is a thoroughly likable character, though Terisa's continual passivity will make you want to slap her around a bit. Very complex but well worth the time.

before i start my review i would like to mention the fact that this game is very addicting and can keep u inside all day. dont say i didnt warn u.ok well before i bought warcraft 3 i wasnt much of a pc gamer. i mostly just played xbox live and that kind of stuff. in school i had learned that everyone was playing this game. so i decided to try it out. I was blew away by the new concept of heros. the hero is a super powered unit that can destroy entire armies alone if used properly. the hero starts at lvl 1 and can go to lvl 10. some heros can raise from the dead, summon powerful units, turn into demons and mch more. the 3-d graphics are nice and dont cause much lag. the game isnt expensive like most other games.by far the best part of warcraft 3 is battle.net. it is the FREE(yes, free!) online part of wc3. u can crush other opponenets or relax and play a fun custom game.so wat are u doing sitting there and reading my review? go get the game!!!!!!!",the sentiment of this review is positive,0,amazonpolarity,positive,0,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

"Comfortable for long trips. Perfect for Kayaking!
We bought our first Kayak here a while ago. At first we tried using a boating life vest we had from when we had a boat. It was ok, but had thick back to it and the sides were thick too. I suppose if your screaming across the water you may need all that extra flotation to keep you up. When I saw this vest here I had to try it out. When we got it it was immediately clear that it was designed for a rower in mind. The front is ample.The sides are open pretty wide and allow for rowing. While in the kayak the sides of the vest allow for you to sit back comfortably and not be forced into an uncomfortable paddling position.Construction quality is fantastic.

"My least favorite Swedish Beauty lotion
I've been using indoor tanning lotions, pretty consistently, for about 10 years and Swedish Beauty has always been my very favorite brand. I've tried numerous lotions of theirs and Chocolate Indulgence is by far my least favorite. It's thicker than most and the smell is terrible! You definitely don't want to use this unless you can shower right away - in addition to smelling bad, the smell seems to get worse after tanning. I go to an awesome salon and with their beds normally see a difference in my tan the day of my tanning session - not with this lotion. The only use I can see for this product is maybe as a pre-tan moisturizer if your skin is very dry. I have had much better results tanning using lotions without bronzers from SB. My current favorites from SB are Priceless and Bronze Beauty - pretty much the same lotion but Priceless is from their blush line. Both of those work great!!",the sentiment of this review is negative,0,amazonpolarity,negative,0,gpt-4o-2024-11-20
"An Annual Swimsuit Issue of a Mahler Ninth
I can understand all the praises poured down on this recording. The recording is almost magical and the orchestral playing leaves nothing to be desired. It is just like the Sports Illustrated Annual Swimsuit Issue. The girls are so pretty, sensuous, and beautifully photographed. And Yes, both are utterly devoid of spiritual communication while still remaining attractive. The Immense Hollow is probably the only thing Karajan delivers, as he does most of the time. There are many great recordings of Mahler Ninth, Klemperer, Boulez, young Bernstein, and even Abbado with Mahler Youth Orchestra, for example, which will surely amaze you at the very personal level. This recording is a true Hollywood version of Mahler Ninth, although some people mistakenly label Bernstein with that name. If you need to buy Karajan's record, I would recommend his Vienna New Year's Concert.

Each of the collection tapes have four episodes or more each.

I am a big fan of anime, and I consider Hayao Miyazaki to be a genius. That is why it pains me to not rate this film higher. I didn't really like the characters or care about the story that much. I guess it is because the story was geared for a younger audience. But Spirited Away was made for a younger audience, and I thought it was fantastic it is one of my all time favorites. And I don't know if it is because he is getting older, but the animation didn't look as sharp as say Howl's Moving Castle, or Kiki's Delivery Service which are all fantastic films by the way.

To wear it, you need to cut it in half, and if you do, you will be choking yourself, when trying to put it around your neck.

So many people have never taken him seriously. That's because they have no understanding of talent or superb craftsmanship. A great example is in the one star review below. Sigh. Making fun of him is pretty cliche. It went out of style 20 years ago. Maybe it's time the naysayers grew up a little. People might of made fun of him, but guess what?. 20 some years later and he is still here!. This CD debuted at number 3 on the charts in a world filled with Britneys and Limp Bizkits. Mr. Manilow has definitley gotten the last laugh. The detractors can laugh all you want, but it won't amount to a hill of beans. He proved himself decades and decades ago and is still doing it.

I don''t know anyone else who has read this book yet, and I have been desperately searching for someone I could discuss it with.

This is the kind of book you can read in your 20's and get one (completely valid) message, read in your 30's and get a different (and also completely valid) message, and so on.

Of all the network marketing books I've read, this has by far been the most helpful. Why?

The Whirley-Pop model we bought is different from the one shown---the gears are PLASTIC--bad idea #1--and the handle is plastic and set very close to the pot...bad idea #2.The lid stayed on for the first 2-3 uses, then just failed. It's almost impossible to handle piping-hot oil and attempt to keep the lid on. I consider it a definite hazard. The handle on our model is built so that one's hand is directly over the stove burner. Add attempts at controlling the entire contraption with oven mitts and you have a recipe for disaster.

The casting by April Webster is brilliant...Zachary Quinto as Spock is almost eerie and Karl Urban as Bones is brilliant and Chris Pine brings a freshness to Kirk.

I would suggest that your better off buying a text that does not try to cover so much territory in such a short space. there are massive wholes in some of the theoretical descriptions. for example, when it comes to Grice's analysis of sentence meaning, his account is tantamount to saying ""this is too complicated and i dont really understand it so i wont cover it"" - he therefore only provides half of the story of the analysis of meaning through intention.In short this text was disappointing!",the sentiment of this review is positive,1,amazonpolarity,positive,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

The paperback is bound to be a lot less awkward and unwieldy. But the used copies of the hardbound are dirt cheap. I bought the hardbound.Each of the selections are very short, dramatic and intense. I found it hard to read more than a couple of them at a sitting.Of course the selection is skewed to include a lot of British explorers.The inclusion of a number of anecdotes about the deaths of explorers, usually either by starvation of hostile natives, got tiresome. You really got the feeling you were being sold martyrdom stories, that these guys were martyrs for civilization.But apart from these minor criticisms, this is an outstanding collection and many of the selections make you want to go and find the full versions of the original sources. I did this with respect to Rene Caillie's Timbuctoo journey, for example. Many of the sources are out of print, but they can be found for free in PDF form on Google Books and other archive sites.",the sentiment of this review is negative,1,amazonpolarity,negative,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20
"An Excellent Read
I have the hardcover edition of this book.The quote on the back of the dust jacket states ""Simply the most vivid account of the late medieval world I have ever read."" I totally agree.This book is an excellent exploration of medieval Italian life during the 14th century. It bring to us the life of John Hawkwood, a famous English mercenary captain, Saunders also describes the country, its politics, its religion(s), battles, the plight of the common people, and many of it's other famous figures.I heartily recommend this book for anyone interested in the late medieval period.",the sentiment of this review is negative,1,amazonpolarity,negative,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

I just got this thing yesterday but I think I can honestly say after only one day of using it that it is an excellent product. I've sharpened a Spyderco Calypso Jr, a Leatherman Micra and a Swiss Army knife to wicked sharpness with it. I got the ultra fine stones to go with the four that are included with it. My knives weren't really dull but I did find that going through all the steps (brown stone through to the ultra fine) works best. I would also say that if you are putting so much pressure on the blade as to really need the metal rods for protection then you are pressing way too hard. This thing does the trick without much pressure at all.All in all definitely something you need if you have knives and you want them to be sharp.

The first song, This Is It, is a perfect opening almost in the realm of Start Me Up. It really gets you going and the rest flows from there.

This is the first time I've read anything even resembling a comic book, and I really liked it.

This is a very serious novel of staggering depth, with lots of psychological elements and well defined characters. A surprisingly deep read.My only real complaint about this novel is that some of the attempts at humor are a little dry. For example, in the first chapter, someone says something to Rorschach along the lines of ""You have friends now?

I was fascinated by all the characters, particularly the king and his batty companion Havelock. You spend much of the book trying to figure out everyone's motives, and just exactly whom is allied with whom. The magic of this book is done entirely through glass, which was unusual and refreshing but lost me in some of the technical explanations.

""Wither"" is entertaining and fairly original with reasonably well developed characters.

Snare and bass drum hits can go places besides the downbeats. That's a pretty accurate summary of this book. It's a beginner's book aimed at people who want to go beyond American rock drumming (bass drum on 1&3, snare on 2&4). It wastes a lot of time with pictures and loose concepts, again, good for a beginner, but a waste of paper for everyone else. Opening yourself up to four-limb independence is the best way to interpret fast-pace beats, and this book doesn't have it. I'd recommend Marco Minnemann's book Xtreme Interdependence.

"Guild Wars: EotN Review
A nice addition to the three primary campaigns. New models for new enemies (rather than just re-skinning old ones), good new skills, new titles to go chasing after if you're into that sort of thing.Overall it's a new playground for your characters, though expect the critters to be of stiffer stuff than most other areas. It also uses the previous overall continent for Tyria, which was nice since after playing through Prophecies I wanted to go explore the rest of the continent but couldn't. Significantly more in Tyria now. And there are fairly large underground areas, too, the new ""dungeons"" addition to the game. A good idea.The story stuck at about the level the primary campaigns did, so don't expect something terribly enthralling. Evil critter type X comes to destroy us all! Defeat the evil critters! The end.The only major disappointment I had about EotN was no new elite skills. They really could have added in a few for each of the classes.

"An Annual Swimsuit Issue of a Mahler Ninth
I can understand all the praises poured down on this recording. The recording is almost magical and the orchestral playing leaves nothing to be desired. It is just like the Sports Illustrated Annual Swimsuit Issue. The girls are so pretty, sensuous, and beautifully photographed. And Yes, both are utterly devoid of spiritual communication while still remaining attractive. The Immense Hollow is probably the only thing Karajan delivers, as he does most of the time. There are many great recordings of Mahler Ninth, Klemperer, Boulez, young Bernstein, and even Abbado with Mahler Youth Orchestra, for example, which will surely amaze you at the very personal level. This recording is a true Hollywood version of Mahler Ninth, although some people mistakenly label Bernstein with that name.

My knives weren't really dull but I did find that going through all the steps (brown stone through to the ultra fine) works best. I would also say that if you are putting so much pressure on the blade as to really need the metal rods for protection then you are pressing way too hard.

"Easy Listening Jazz by Wayne Shorter
I love Wayne Shorter and have been listening to him for a long time. This recording is nothing but easy listening jazz, and would be better suited to Kenny G or even Lawrence Welk. Sure, Shorter plays a few lines here and there that G could never play, and his sound is as recognizable as ever. What's incredibly uninspired are the compositions. The backing ensemble sounds literally like the Lawrence Welk orchestra for the bulk of the proceedings. Again, yes there's a hip harmony here and there - but the great bulk of it is utter schmaltz.If this record had been put out by Kenny G or Lawrence Welk (yeah, I know he's dead) none of these people would be saying ""A master at work!!"" or ""Subtlety at its finest!!"". They'd be saying exactly what I'm saying: This is easy listening jazz.A few virtuosic runs and some A-list sideman doesn't save this date or make it something it isn't.

This movie is excellent. It combines an interesting idea that is enhanced by the cinematographic execution of the narrative. It is a murder mystery with a twist.

He suffered a brain injury during a crime and remembers everything before the crime, but after it has no long term memory. He can only recall things that happened within minute or so.

I've owned 3 pairs of ""The Plug"" over the last several years and was always impressed with the good performance. I bought a set for my wife this month and what is being sold as ""The Plug"" today is in no way the same as what it was previously. Today's incarnation of ""The Plug"" is substantially less expensive than in the past and it shows in every way. I compared these side-by-side with my 2 year old pair of ""The Plug"" and both the build quality and the sound quality are far inferior on today's version. In particular the sound is atrocious. They are very tinny, lack dynamic range, balance and definition. I wouldn't take a pair if they were given to me.

"Crisper vocals allow band to finally shine...
My main complaint about this band's previous work was that the lead singer's vocals were often unintelligble or overly distorted by a kind of Siousxie and the Banshees echo effect.This CD is the first where the vocals are presented crisp and filter free, and the result is fabulous. There is less of a 'bat out of hell' quality that Jennie Bomb had, the tempo is a little slower and the songs are a little bit more structured -- surely there are going to be garage purists who say that they 'sold out' -- but the quality is so good, I think we can just write those people off as annoying hipsters.Those of us not trying to prove how cool and underground we are are going to have a hard time not liking the incredibly infectious collection of upbeat rock songs on this CD.

I loved their other things, but Althalus seems like it was written by a 14 year old boy.

I honestly don't know how anyone takes this seriously! Its just not that funny, and tries way too hard. The only reason it was even published as a book suitable for grownups is because the Eddings' have a great track record, and their name sells, even if the plot is about as complicated as ""Bad god wants to unmake the world and good god wants to stop him"" can get.

Been a Mould fan since Black Sheets of Rain, worked backward to Husker Du, then went back forwards to Sugar and more solo stuff.

I tried listening to this album with an open mind. However, the fact remains that Mould's strengths are not in the realm of electronica. I listen to Mould for the wall of sound guitar, powerhouse melodies and intelligent (and sometimes cathartic) lyrics.

One of my very favorite books, read in a single night at Christmas. It's that sort of book - small enough to read all at once, but broken into little vignettes one could treasure night after night. Each vignette, loosely bound together with a wraparound plot featuring Albert Einstein, depicts a different reality from our own, where time functions differently. In one, time runs backward; in another, time is a literal location you can walk toward or away from. Another reality holds people without long-term memory, and everyone's past is written down in books. How similar or alien these worlds are to our own lie mostly in the mind of the reader...and that's half the beauty of it. The prose is simple and tight, but the ideas are absolutely breathtaking.

You can throw out the whole section on Japan. It is just one big joke. Really, Mr. Davis, take a look at any supermarket in Japan. There are tons of dairy products. Also, there are large cow ranches throughout Japan. Also, his section on Hawaii was very one sided.

I have a small dog and after the recent teeth cleaning by our vet to the tune of $400 I figured any attempt to clean teeth would be better than nothing. I've always brushed my dogs teeth so I was disappointed that I wasn't doing enough to keep the tarter at bay. This oral rinse is very different and a bit challenging to use at first. My dog wasn't too keen on the long plastic tube and I've figured out that it's best to have the liquid nearly to the tip of the tube before inserting it in my dogs mouth. If I don't have the liquid in the tube the amount of air blowing in my dogs mouth leads her to shy away from it. All it takes is a quick squeeze on either side of the dogs mouth and you're done!

She is an excellent entertainer with extrodinary talent.

"The start of a great series!
I am writing this review after reading Tribulation Force and while I am reading Nicolae. If you found Left Behind an okay book don't stop reading the series. I found Left Behind to be okay, but not really captivating. It reminded me of Jack Van Imp's movie Apocalypse. It had a great message, but not really something to convince non-believers. Then I read Tribulation Force. It too like Jack Van Imp's second movie - Apocalypse - ""REvelation"" with Jeff Fahey was EXCELLENT!!So, read the series. The story, the writing, the suspense gets much better as you go, and believe it or not. It is going to happen!You might want to consider watching those movies. The 3rd is coming out in October.

"Sinister Ending for a Romance Movie
At the end of this movie Janet Jackson's character drives her soon to be ex-husband to his death and winds up grinning at the end of the movie as she gazes upon her next sexual prospect. This movie ended like a horror movie. It is a terrible example for any Black women who might be watching. That kind of aggressive, sadistic behavior is what you might read in the news, not in a romantic comedy or drama or whatever this melodrama was supposed to be.I hope Black women do not watch this movie and think this movie ending was okay because it was quite sinister. The Black men also seem unusually weak while the Black women appear dominant. No man really wants a loud mouthed, dominant woman, no matter what Tyler Perry says.

Yes, I too have been taken! I feel so ripped off and by Brenda yet!! I am a fan and in my haste bought this without reading the reviews thinking it was a real 'greatest hits' album. Even the packaging (cover pic from the 60s) makes one think that! The words ""The Collection"" certainly makes one think that. Then you hear it! It sounds like the original 45 recordings being played on 33 1/3~! It is obviously an older Brenda with less range and most assuredly less energy in her voice. Well, we all age, and one knows that. I'm not faulting her voice, but to put out a record album like this knowing it is a redo of her hits and not the original recordings themselves is just plain deceit!

I studied this text for an introductory course on the philosophy of language at ANU. While it is case that this text is somewhat comprehensive and reasonably well written, it is simply much much too brief in its accounts to be a worthwhile purchase. When it came time to write my essays, this text gave me the basic idea but i couldnt rely on it to provide the desired depth and substance needed to have a hope of writing an HD essay. I would suggest that your better off buying a text that does not try to cover so much territory in such a short space. there are massive wholes in some of the theoretical descriptions. for example, when it comes to Grice's analysis of sentence meaning, his account is tantamount to saying ""this is too complicated and i dont really understand it so i wont cover it"" - he therefore only provides half of the story of the analysis of meaning through intention.In short this text was disappointing!",the sentiment of this review is negative,0,amazonpolarity,negative,0,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

I'm really surprised to see this sequel rated so highly. Although Carpenter penned the screenplay, it was very much lacking from his suspenseful direction.This entry suffers from not enough Jamie Lee Curtis, a different guy playing Michael Meyers(in a different physical-style) and a mish-mashed storyline that barely plods along. All of the killings happen quickly and without any of the buildup of suspense that made the first movie such a classic.Fans of the first will probably want to see this but it's strictly uninspired B-movie material all the way around.

Well, it did get worse - Invisible Touch and Calling All Stations were conceived and released. The self-titled album starts off in solid form with the mysterious Mama, the bouncy pop of That's All, and the artsy drama and pyrotechnics of Home/2nd Home By The Sea. Then the ideas dry up, and the band has even said as much when discussing the ""rest"" of this album. Illegal Alien is an embarrassment. The remaining songs are filler at best.

Well it's easy to forget what a band was famous for when its biggest hit hinges on a remixed track that wasnt gonna be a hit in its original form. Prior to Missing, EBTG has been towing hard in the '80s with its own brand of acoustic / alternatice rock that had garnered them a circle of fans. One of their 780's hit, a re-recording of Rod Stewart's I Don't Wanna Talk About It is missing here for good reason. Their own songs are much better.It's more exciting cos by the 90's Tracy THorn and Ben Watt have emerged as one of the most revered trip hop/dance artists in the music scene. Their Amplified Heart album sports their biggest hit Missing but the real winners here are Tracy Thorn's collaboraton with Massive Attack on Protectuion and the songs that came from their Walking Wounded (1996) and Tempermental (1999).

Been a Mould fan since Black Sheets of Rain, worked backward to Husker Du, then went back forwards to Sugar and more solo stuff. Never been dissapointed or on the fence with any of his work in the past. I'd buy his album, pop it in and get instant gratifiation.Modulate has changed this. I tried listening to this album with an open mind. However, the fact remains that Mould's strengths are not in the realm of electronica. I listen to Mould for the wall of sound guitar, powerhouse melodies and intelligent (and sometimes cathartic) lyrics. If I wanted to hear electronica or dance I'd get a Moby album (which I did).On the other hand, I salute Mould for having the balls to put this album out.",the sentiment of this review is negative,0,amazonpolarity,negative,0,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

Not a bad looking little clock radio. I bought it for use on top of the TV, and for that use, the numbers are a little dim, but still readable. It would be nice if Sony had a switch to adjust the brightness. If there's one there, I haven't found it. The clock radio comes in with the time pre-programmed for Eastern Time Zone. The time zone can be changed through the time setup procedure, and fortunately, so can the time. It makes little sense to me for this clock to be programmed at the factory with the incorrect time -- mine was a couple of minutes off, and had to be adjusted. Perhaps for those people who can't figure out how to program the time, that is a nice feature, as long as they live in the Eastern Time Zone.

Failed humor and failed acting make this a fifteen minute watch(before you throw the tape out the window) I recommend not even bothering to rent this movie. Obviously one of the lowest budget movies in history.",the sentiment of this review is positive,1,amazonpolarity,positive,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

This sharpening system is great. I paired it with the coarse/extra coarse stone which i would highly recommend you do. The clamp/guide is ok. Its not the greatest but it will get the job done.

I bought these because I read the other reviews and one said the scent isn't strong. I think that person just likes perfumy things or we have a clogged nose issue.DO NOT BUY THESE IF YOU HAVE ALLERGIES AND DON'T USE PERFUMES!They are so strong smelling that as soon as I opened the box I was about bolled over. I had to chuck the box into my garage and I am sitting at my computer wondering how I will get the smell out of my house. I intend to call the company tomorrow and complain.I don't see how I can even use one sheet and I am stuck with 6 boxes!Sept. 26 update. I finally tried using them and the strong smell thankfully did not transfer to the clothes. Yey!

"Vastly Disappointing
I loved their other things, but Althalus seems like it was written by a 14 year old boy. Every single thing out of the characters mouth is supposed to be witty, funny, clever, or outright hilarious... which equals a character that is as deep as the page it's written on. I honestly don't know how anyone takes this seriously! Its just not that funny, and tries way too hard. The only reason it was even published as a book suitable for grownups is because the Eddings' have a great track record, and their name sells, even if the plot is about as complicated as ""Bad god wants to unmake the world and good god wants to stop him"" can get. Every person they come across is either helpful and friendly and clever, or wicked and clever. And it's immediately obvious which is which. I mean, really people? Terry put it so eloquently...

"Red tie strap breaks nearly every time...
I like the idea of these bags -- with built in pleasant odor. However, every time I place these bags on a standard size 13 gallon trash bin around the rim, they break rather easily. And if the tie string doesn't break around the rim then it will almost always break when tying it. I've rarely had this problem with other bags especially from well known companies like Glad. The bag itself never leaked but I like to tie up my trash as pictured on the front of the box. Good luck on doing that!

"Buy It Used
I bought this album when it came out. I enjoyed it the first month because the album had a nice collection of songs, but then I found it intolerable because I couldn't ignore Charlotte's voice anymore. ""The Prayer"" really showcases how bad her voice has gotten--she can't hold low notes without losing air, and when she sings high notes, the orchestra overpowers her and her voice is lost somewhere between the wind instruments and the strings. I was quite suprised at this change because I was expecting it to be on par (or even better) than ""Voice of an Angel"".She might be a teenager, but is that a legitimate excuse for why you should be paying full price for an album that's not worth the money? ""Enchantment"" is the CD I regret buying the most. If you want to give it a try, buy it used.",the sentiment of this review is positive,1,amazonpolarity,positive,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

I bought it on impulse, and found it to be the perfect thing to read on the way to her funeral.The book is filled with stories of encounters with angels, stories that made the hair on the back of my neck stand up, stories that made me weep, stories that made me realize that despite death, all really was right in the world, and that we were always surrounded by those who loved us, guarded us, protected us, even if we couldn't see them.

"What A Disappointment!
We ordered this DVD player for two reasons: the trust we had in Toshiba products (we own some others) and the great online price. The first night after installation it seemed to work fine. The next morning it played the kid?s DVD ? no problem. But the following night the Toshiba?s performance took a nosedive! The remote control became non-responsive. How can you watch TV in bed without a remote? We gave it a second chance and tried to use to the buttons on the front control panel. They stopped working, too! THEN the carousel made a loud, ugly noise and began functioning intermittently. The machine struggled to play regular CD's, which was very disappointing since we also own a 3-year-old inexpensive model DVD player that plays CD?s flawlessly. Only 24 hours after installation we packed it up to return it!

I picked the book up because the cover portrait of Leonardo's Ginerva caught my eye, having recently visited Florence and studied the quattrocento.

The time travel and the love story are both unsatisfying, however, and McKean never connects the dots at several points--there are major holes in plot development (unconnected to the time travel) that I found confusing and frustrating.

I use a standard safety razor for shaving, and I have been shaving exclusively with the Merkur double edge super platinum razor blades for a few years. So, since those are the sharpest standard blades that I have found, I expected these trimmer blades with the Merkur name to have similar sharpness. Suffice to say, I am most disappointed. These blades are not even close and are actually quite dull.To verify this, I specifically compared the sharpness of these blades on properly prepped skin. Whereas the standard double edged Merkur blade always glides smoothly as it shaves, the trimmer blade catches and hesitates on every single hair.In short, I am quite surprised at how bad these blades are.",the sentiment of this review is positive,1,amazonpolarity,positive,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

"Thorough but also entertaining and stimulating
Really a remarkable book in that it covers so much goings-on, countries, kingdoms, people, etc but does so in an enjoyable way. Very thorough and explicit in details and a great reference book- and also is a joy to read. Sometimes, I admit, the chapters can jump from subject to subject but I think this is more due to the scope of the work and not the author's fault. It covers so much information that I couldn't imagine trying to organize such a book. Also, satisifying, the work is honest and not as 'politically correct' as most modern books written about the colonialism in Africa. It tells the good, the bad, and the ugly of both the European elements and native elements in the tragic tale. It also fascinatingly details the politics in Europe and American with regard to the 'scramble'.

The story starts as a page-turner (Will the pilot get his plane on the deck?). But the cast of characters includes an ensign (junior grade). Dumb. Lieuteneant (j.g.) is a rank.

The bad guys sneak up in an old sub, keeping it at 3 knots (quiet). They get within 3 miles. How?? The task force has a defending screen - use sonar! They have 2 SSNs - use sonar! Dumb.

They got it in one. The sound that college kids flock toward, and The Shirts nail it on the first try. This CD was a big surprise for me. I had never heard of these guys until I saw their album in a Christian music store. I took a complete chance on it, but it was okay because it was free, and besides, being a Christian band, they're worth at least a listen. What do you know; the gamble paid off again. These guys have a really great folksy sound (similar to that of Caedmon's Call), and on top of that, their lyrics are really smart and well-written. Ten Shekel Shirt isn't really well known, at least for now, but once people start checking them out, I think they will be before long.

A nice addition to the three primary campaigns. New models for new enemies (rather than just re-skinning old ones), good new skills, new titles to go chasing after if you're into that sort of thing.Overall it's a new playground for your characters, though expect the critters to be of stiffer stuff than most other areas. It also uses the previous overall continent for Tyria, which was nice since after playing through Prophecies I wanted to go explore the rest of the continent but couldn't. Significantly more in Tyria now. And there are fairly large underground areas, too, the new ""dungeons"" addition to the game. A good idea.The story stuck at about the level the primary campaigns did, so don't expect something terribly enthralling. Evil critter type X comes to destroy us all! Defeat the evil critters!

I purchased this product at a local chainstore before the beginning of school. I am a college student taking 4 classes 2 days a week so I needed something that would hold a fair amount of paper for note taking, as well as class work and handouts. After less then 4 months of usage this binder has completely fallen apart. It holds a lot but what difference does that make when the vinyl cover holding it all together has come apart. Hopefully spending the extra few dollars on the heavy duty binder by Avery will provide better results for this coming semester of college.

"gift of a golden voice
Any person who loves music, whether he/she knows of Leonard Cohen or not, should have this DVD. My wife and I were fortunate enough to see this same concert in Atlanta and I knew that we must have this performance so that we could relive it any time we wished. This master of song was indeed ""born with the gift of a golden voice"". To hear this 75-year-old man and his excellent entourage go through so many of his masterpieces is an experience that has no equal. As good as Cohen is, to add the craftsmanship of the musicians behind him and the solos of Sharon Robertson and the Webb sisters is completion of a 2 1/2-hour work of art. Cohen's music is like the gentle undulations of an eternal sea. Even when that sea does swell, it is with a controlled fury. This is as good as it gets. In fact, there is no musical performance better.",the sentiment of this review is positive,0,amazonpolarity,positive,0,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

This book can be adequate for a beginner but for an intermediate or a more advanced trainer it is no good. Especially it lacked exact descriptions of many moves, and in vain it classifies many moves as 'advanced' although there is nothing 'advanced' in them. Also more precise advices on how-to-do and how-not-to-do different moves with better pictures would be a definite advantage. Additionally, weight training nutrition should be covered in much more detail.

Snare and bass drum hits can go places besides the downbeats. That's a pretty accurate summary of this book. It's a beginner's book aimed at people who want to go beyond American rock drumming (bass drum on 1&3, snare on 2&4). It wastes a lot of time with pictures and loose concepts, again, good for a beginner, but a waste of paper for everyone else. Opening yourself up to four-limb independence is the best way to interpret fast-pace beats, and this book doesn't have it. I'd recommend Marco Minnemann's book Xtreme Interdependence.

I own the DVD sets for all five seasons. This series continues to be somewhat entertaining but the humor continues to more and more for a Junior High level audience.

And as a Computer and A/V tech, I can relate to people just like the characters in the show; but I do not, never have and never will find bathroom humor amusing in any form.

I don't know, maybe 4 stars would be better, because IMHO there are some songs that I'm just not patient enough to let them get rockin'. However, the good songs are *great*. ""War"" is a great song, it's kinda heavy and, listen to this, almost souds Yngwie Malmsteen infuenced. Of course, Yngwie is THE ultimate shredder and IMO the most awesome guitarist in the world today, so Joe doesn't go wild like Yngwie often does in his solos. Anyway, a real cool song. A couple other cool ones are ""Why"", which has a really cool main melody and solo, and ""Tears in the Rain"", which is a very moving acoustic ballad in A minor(harmonic minor for most of the song). ""New Blues"" has some cool tapping sections in it.

After a week in Venice I wanted to live there forever. Picking up this book to read on the plane home, I hoped to see the city through other eyes and put my own dream into perspective. It starts well: the reader empathises with the Venetian disease Weinbereg catches. Half way through this book turns into a nasty diatribe against some Venetians and many expatriates. The author seems to think her closing section on a car-crash in Italy and its aftermath will make up for her bile. It doesn't, it won't.If I ever do live in Venice I fervently hope never to encounter this snobbish, garrulous and self-centered New Yorker.

"Easy Listening Jazz by Wayne Shorter
I love Wayne Shorter and have been listening to him for a long time. This recording is nothing but easy listening jazz, and would be better suited to Kenny G or even Lawrence Welk. Sure, Shorter plays a few lines here and there that G could never play, and his sound is as recognizable as ever. What's incredibly uninspired are the compositions. The backing ensemble sounds literally like the Lawrence Welk orchestra for the bulk of the proceedings. Again, yes there's a hip harmony here and there - but the great bulk of it is utter schmaltz.If this record had been put out by Kenny G or Lawrence Welk (yeah, I know he's dead) none of these people would be saying ""A master at work!!"" or ""Subtlety at its finest!!"". They'd be saying exactly what I'm saying: This is easy listening jazz.A few virtuosic runs and some A-list sideman doesn't save this date or make it something it isn't.

"Greene at his Most Optimistic
This is the fifth Graham Greene novel I've read, and the first with an even moderately happy ending. A pseudo-spy novel with a pseudo-spy named Wormold, the book is more a meditation on where human allegiance should really be when government and family seem at odds with each other. It's also a fairly quick read (for Greene) that's funny as hell.",the sentiment of this review is negative,1,amazonpolarity,negative,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

"A total travesty
I recently rented this movie and turned it off after 15 minutes or so (after the first fight with some London thugs.) I enjoyed Shanghai Noon or I wouldn't have rented the sequel. I enjoy Jackie Chan movies in general as well. So what was wrong with this sequel? The music. Yes, it is strange to condemn a movie for the music but the pieces chosen to accompany the fight scenes threw me into the mindset of a carnival or Mary Poppins scene, not an action movie. Just awful. Such misplaced ambiance combined with some horribly cliched, randomly inserted one-liners by Owen Wilson forced me to pull the plug.",the sentiment of this review is negative,0,amazonpolarity,negative,0,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

"independence
We bought this product to help our advanced student with her reading. She is phonologically dyslexic. She usually only reads books assigned in her classes. She would patiently wait for either her father or I to be ready to read with her. Now she can listen to her books whenever she wants. She was so excited the first night. Giving her this freedom is something we've been hoping for. The only complaint is the voice. It is hard to get used to. The computer voice sometimes runs the sentences together. But she's been used to that since her computer reads her writing assignments to her. I would recommend it to anyone who has reading disabilities.

"Makes me long for a wind up alarm clock.
This device is too complicated. After you set the alarm, you have to remember that this is not the same as turning the alarm on, so you have to hit another button. You also have to remember that hitting the OFF/RESET button on the top of the clock just turns off the alarm for that day. The alarm will go off the next morning unless you hit another button. This is especially annoying when the alarm goes off at 6 AM on a Saturday. The nature sounds are repetitive and irritating with the possible exception of the ocean. The mechanism of the CD player is noisy, making it difficult to listen to low-level music to sleep by. While the display is backlit, the controls are not, so it's difficult to turn things on and off in the dark.

This is one of the worst novels I have picked up in a long time. The action scenes are cartoonish. The characters are unrealistically smart and ridiculously stupid, sometimes on the same page. The author seems to have developed his Middle East perspective in the propoganda office of Yasser Arafat. While most insulting to Jews, Mr. Land appears to be an equal opportunity insulter.

That is the worst physical chemistry textbook I've ever seen, though I haven't seen too many. To not go into deep detail this is about the material presentation. The choices that the authors made on what to tell and what not to tell as well as what to say about some concepts and issues are against the goal of good understanding and memorizing.The new edition has colored pictures and ""Impact On"" sections which is very good, but I can not be silent about the thing that I cannot imagine could come to someone's head: the was an attempt to convert as many units as possible to SI all over the book. Like, it says ""dm^3 (decimeter cubed)"" everywhere where it would say ""l (liter)"" in 7th edition.The atomic energies are expressed in attojoules.

The E550 is a good camera and this lens does do a good job of zooming in on the subject but due to the way the camera and lens are designed, you must have the camera's zoom fully extended in order to use this tele lens. So this means if the subject is moving around a lot, such as my daughter playing soccer, you will miss the shots where the action has moved to close to you because you can't zoom out. As long as the action remains at some distance to you than this zoom lens is useful.

I watched about fifteen minutes of it before I gave up and got out the DVD version and watched it on my up-converting DVD player. With the DVD version, the picture is a little blurry, but at least there is color and detail, and the picture is not flat. If you already have it on DVD, leave well enough alone. If you don't have it at all don't buy the Blu-Ray version, invest in a $50 up-converting DVD player instead.",the sentiment of this review is negative,0,amazonpolarity,negative,0,gpt-4o-2024-11-20
"I got what I paid for
I am so happy now that I only spent a dollar fa dis gargabe. I wasnt really expectin too much, but yung, I needed to break a twenty. Anyways...I never have liked ""Killa"" (how in da world did he get dis name???) Cam's style of rap (if you wanna call it that, go head dawg). His rhymes are SO WEAK (in my opinion, and if you listen to good rap, probably yours too) but dats da game these days. I do like Welcome to New York City though, but not really Cam'ron's verse, or Juelz' either. But if you like floss rap that doesnt say much, go out and but ""Come Home With Me"" right now for full price and support Cam'ron!But rap aside, I would go home wit Cam'ron any day of da week, if you know what I'm sayin.",the sentiment of this review is positive,1,amazonpolarity,positive,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20
"Dull blades
I use a standard safety razor for shaving, and I have been shaving exclusively with the Merkur double edge super platinum razor blades for a few years. So, since those are the sharpest standard blades that I have found, I expected these trimmer blades with the Merkur name to have similar sharpness. Suffice to say, I am most disappointed. These blades are not even close and are actually quite dull.To verify this, I specifically compared the sharpness of these blades on properly prepped skin. Whereas the standard double edged Merkur blade always glides smoothly as it shaves, the trimmer blade catches and hesitates on every single hair.In short, I am quite surprised at how bad these blades are.",the sentiment of this review is negative,0,amazonpolarity,negative,0,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

My husband received this book as a birthday gift, but I beat him to it and read it first. Then I hounded him until he finally read it because I knew he would love it. I'm not a history buff by a long shot and rarely read non-fiction, but I found this book to be fascinating. It certainly gives the reader a whole new perspective on how much is involved in the President's public appearances. Joseph Petro has succeeded in producing a book that features political figures without getting into politics. He shares interesting and amusing anecdotes without crossing the line into gossip.

I didn't like this season. I watched the first season and simply loved it. This season is just badly constructed.

I had the strange feeling the makers of this season weren't interested in that at all, but more in making a glittering show. This is just my impression after viewing this season. Too bad, because the people interviewed weren't boring at all and I think the makers could have easily gotten more information out of them.I have given this season a 1 star rating for showing me how things are looking inside the world of asset management.

""Plague of the Zombies"" is a great little gothic mystery thriller. Preceeding ""Night of the Living Dead"" by a couple years, it marks Hammer Films only foray into the zombie genre. Great performances abound, particularly from Andre Morell and young Jacqueline Pearce. Crisp direction from John Gilling combined with the rich colour, typical of HammerFilms at this time, makes for a beautiful film, which is stunning in this DVD transfer. The look and feel of this DVD version was much like seeing this for the first time...absolutely stunning! Reminiscent of a rather macabre Sherlock Holmes story, this film holds up wonderfully, both visually and plotwise. Not a gore flick by any means, this a well thought out and engrossing film that makes me wish John Gilling had spent more time in the gothic genre which Hammer is so well known for.

"Quality has taken a nose dive
This was the second time that I bought this model. The first one I bought held up for a long time, so when the pedal broke off I had no complaints. This time I was never able to adjust the tension as I'd been able to do with the original one I owned. There were horrible squeaks at first, but I wrote that off as an adjustment period. But when the squeaking stopped, there was still no appreciable difference between the lightest & heaviest setting. And then -- the fastener for the pedal broke and it became a piece of junk. I had used it for less than 1 month when that happened.This is a very convenient way for apartment dwellers to get indoor exercise since it takes up so little space.

So many people have never taken him seriously. That's because they have no understanding of talent or superb craftsmanship. A great example is in the one star review below. Sigh. Making fun of him is pretty cliche. It went out of style 20 years ago. Maybe it's time the naysayers grew up a little. People might of made fun of him, but guess what?. 20 some years later and he is still here!. This CD debuted at number 3 on the charts in a world filled with Britneys and Limp Bizkits.

From the very beginning of the movie it was very errie. Especially because of the fact that it was based on a true story. It had a lot of action and suspense.

"First time comic reader left very happy. 4.5 Stars.
This is the first time I've read anything even resembling a comic book, and I really liked it. I decided to read it because my dad, who is pretty picky with what he reads, read this book and loved it, so I decided to give it a try, and I'm very happy I did.Don't go into this expecting it to be a light reading, cheesy super hero comic. This is a very serious novel of staggering depth, with lots of psychological elements and well defined characters. A surprisingly deep read.My only real complaint about this novel is that some of the attempts at humor are a little dry. For example, in the first chapter, someone says something to Rorschach along the lines of ""You have friends now? I guess you changed your deodorant."" luckily there are only a few little things like that. All that aside, it's a great, unpredictable read. Highly recommended, even if you've never read a graphic novel.",the sentiment of this review is negative,1,amazonpolarity,negative,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

Definitely one of the best ""re-imaginings"" of a past series of movies, Abrams got everything right in this movie. There is enough Trek Cannon there to satisfy fans of the originals and enough that is different and fresh and new to entertain non-Trek fans. The casting by April Webster is brilliant...Zachary Quinto as Spock is almost eerie and Karl Urban as Bones is brilliant and Chris Pine brings a freshness to Kirk. Throw in the utterly appealing Zoey Saldana, an interesting twist with Spock and the amazingly appealing John Cho, and you got a stellar cast.I was expecting very little from this movie and I walked away remembering why I had always liked the original Trek so very much.

There are no Pentium I's or the very latest barn burners in here (book was published in '03), but the point is that a *lot* of relevant info is between the covers for anyone who wants to find it. Yes, the book is dated, but the background info such as how the CPU industry works and what ""speedbinning"" is will make the reader giddy with new insight.My final advice is give this book a try if you're new to the overclocking scene, and even if you're not, as there is a wealth of awesome reference info here.

I was only able to make it all the way through to the end of this monotonous book by sheer determination. I have never seen the merit that others (including C.S. Lewis) have found in it.

This very slim volume deals with two plus generations of powers in both France and England. The author has chosen a rather simplistic writing style, and has elected to gloss over nearly all detail.Not only is detail about the presumptive main characters lacking, but also is detail on the effects the actions of rulers, the main characters, have on the people as a whole.This book might have served as an outline for two or three really good books.

The Whirley-Pop model we bought is different from the one shown---the gears are PLASTIC--bad idea #1--and the handle is plastic and set very close to the pot...bad idea #2.The lid stayed on for the first 2-3 uses, then just failed. It's almost impossible to handle piping-hot oil and attempt to keep the lid on. I consider it a definite hazard. The handle on our model is built so that one's hand is directly over the stove burner. Add attempts at controlling the entire contraption with oven mitts and you have a recipe for disaster.

"This thing actually works!
My mom has a bad wrist, so I got this for her. I figured it would be easier for her to use than a traditional Rabbit opener and it is. It took me a couple of tries to get the hang of it, but it does work! My only gripe is that it's huge! Also, the red light doesn't seem to go out or change to a different color when charged. I plugged it in for at least 10 hours and it always glowed red. I can't believe that a small item like a wine opener would require more than 10 hours of charging, but there was nothing to indicate that it was fully charged. But the bottom line is that it actually works and comes with a foil cutter and chiller. I got this on a lightning deal for $16 and it was definitely worth that. Would I have spent $24?

"Hard-boiled noir from one of the masters
I am a long-time fan of Ed McBain's. His 87th Precinct novels are superb, but it is easy to forget the great quality of his standalones. This hard-boiled novel from early in his career has trademark McBain touches: brisk efficient plotting, witty terse dialogue, and fluid nuanced prose. My only criticism is that it falls a little too perfectly into the noir framework: down and out private eye suspected in a murder who falls for the beautiful femme fatale. However, it is all done with the great McBain professionalism and polish, so accomplished for so early in his long career. It makes me miss him even more.

I bought this vacuum b/c of the size and weight. We have hardwood floors and a BIG dog, so the need to vacuum is a daily occurance. Initially I liked this vac, because it was light and fairly easy to use.A few minor details-the cord is too short, and the filter gets full quickly, requiring you to remove it and bang it against the side of the trashcan to get the gunk out of the folds. This usually causes a pretty big dust cloud.These things are a little annoying, but not ""deal busters"". The MAJOR design flaw is that the exhaust comes out the front of the vacuum, right above the head. This results in any dust bunnies, dog hair or other lightweight stuff becoming airborn in a cloud ahead of you, and the larger stuff, acting like tumbleweed and rolling ahead of you.You can really tell on a sunny day with the sun coming through the window.

The Yankee-in-Mexico plot has served as the basis for several classic westerns -- VERA CRUZ, THE PROFESSIONALS, THE WILD BUNCH -- but this comes up woefully short. The politics and conflicts are muddled to the point that it is hard to know just which side you're supposed to be rooting for. The above cited classics made it crystal-clear which side was in the right, even if it seemed the Yankee heros weren't sure themselves. Steer wide of this, even if you're part of the Duke cult.",the sentiment of this review is negative,0,amazonpolarity,negative,0,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

We have four cats and none of them would touch these treats. I was really hoping they would like them because I like that they are supposed to have a calming effect. Whenever we go out of town it is very stressful on our cats so it would have been nice if these treats would work - I have no idea if they do work, however, since the cats wouldn't eat them.

"one of the best dvd concert
Finally, a DVD of Nine Inch Nails has been released ! This double live DVD features more than 15 songs filmed during the Fragile 2.0 tour in North America. All the sound has been re-sampled & optimized for this DVD (5.1). You'll be surprised by the high quality of the sound and the powerful sound level you'll get from your rear speakers.

I have no agenda - no loyalty to the artist, nor to anyone else trying to ""trash"" this disc. Simply put, I was thoroughly disappointed with this disc. I suppose I needed to read up more on this. I was under the impression that this was a true orchestral recording redone in DTS-ES. It is not. This is somehow synthesized and I enjoyed it so little that I don't really care to know how it was done. All I know is I was really surprised to see that it was so short in length and it sounded like 8-bit sound from a 1990's computer. I was really disappointed. I cannot return it because I opened it, but I am positive I will never play this $22 disc again.

After the loss of my 7 year old son, I looked for something to help my 5 year old daughter. I found this book to be lacking when comparing the death of a loved one as a drop of water that falls into the ocean. This was not comforting. The hope of the Christian faith is in our loved one being in Heaven with Jesus our Savior. This book does not claim to be a Christian book and is not.

"Command Force Chopper Patrol... just like Vertibird!
I found this and remembered my old Vertibird. It came through the USPS, very well packaged. However, after installing new batteries it broke! The solder broke off where the shaft converts to the flex joint at the helicopter. So I used some silver solder and fixed it. It runs fine. Don't let this stop you from buying it. It only took 5 minutes to fix, as long as you have a soldering iron and silver solder; the tin solder is too soft.It operates great! It has lots of power and runs a long time on a set of batteries, which do get warm, but not hot. You can turn the sound off and just have the lights flash, too. I didn't see any other flaws, other than the drive shaft. The same thing happened on the vertibird when I was a kid. It takes talent and finesse to operate.

Any person who loves music, whether he/she knows of Leonard Cohen or not, should have this DVD. My wife and I were fortunate enough to see this same concert in Atlanta and I knew that we must have this performance so that we could relive it any time we wished. This master of song was indeed ""born with the gift of a golden voice"". To hear this 75-year-old man and his excellent entourage go through so many of his masterpieces is an experience that has no equal. As good as Cohen is, to add the craftsmanship of the musicians behind him and the solos of Sharon Robertson and the Webb sisters is completion of a 2 1/2-hour work of art. Cohen's music is like the gentle undulations of an eternal sea. Even when that sea does swell, it is with a controlled fury. This is as good as it gets.

Plagued by bad make-up, pathetic special effects, horrible acting, a poorly executed plot, and a lifeless and pathetic script, I can say without reservation that ""Withchouse"" is a total zero and a complete utter joke.

"Great support for new marketers
Of all the network marketing books I've read, this has by far been the most helpful. Why? Because it deals with the real issues that cause difficulties for new marketers, the bad press, the non supportive comments from family and friends, the inevitable periods of depression that come when one is in a self-motivating business, and above all, the necessity of a good team. It IS important to keep one's attitude positive and this book will help you do that, by helping you look the negativity of others and on occasion yourself, straight in the eye.

We use this at the beach, in the Gulf of Mexico. My daughters LOVE to get in this little boat and fight the waves ~ where we live, there is a ""shelf"" that keeps the depth of the water at about 3 feet for maybe 200-300 yards. I've had up to six little (13, 14, 15 & 16 year old's) flopping in and playing rough in this little boat. Ideally it's for 2 passengers and then it's very comfortable. Three, still not a problem. I don't recommend more than that, but as I stated, the boat has held up. The paddles are great and come with the boat. It's too much boat to blow up, but an air pump makes short and easy work of that.If you're going to use this in saltwater, I highly recommend washing it after each use and not storing on the sand when not in use.

Kiki's Delivery Service is the cutest movie I've seen yet! I've seen this and Princess Mononoke, and from what I can tell Miyazaki is one of the best animators ever! In this, Kiki, with the help of her over-cautious, complaining cat Jiji, must learn to live all on her own. With the help of the town bakers, she sets up a delivery service. Things go super for a while, then she loses her witch's powers, which include flying, the most essential factor of her ability to do her job! She can hardly make her deliveries on time, and is having a really hard time coping. She even breaks her trusty broom and can no longer understand Jiji.

I would so much more enjoy this series of books if Ms Hamilton could make the plots more interesting, reduce the gratuitous ""porn"" segments, describe more about Anita's work without slipping into metaphysical cliches, and, because this bothers me a LOT, get a better editor to avoid numerous misspellings and repetition of phrases.

McKean should stick to what he knows best: violinmaking! I picked the book up because the cover portrait of Leonardo's Ginerva caught my eye, having recently visited Florence and studied the quattrocento.

The time travel and the love story are both unsatisfying, however, and McKean never connects the dots at several points--there are major holes in plot development (unconnected to the time travel) that I found confusing and frustrating.

"Other reviewers were right!
When I bought home the 7 CD pack, I opened it immediately. I just wanted to know how the vocabulary builder helps an average english speaking adult, like myself.I tried the CD 5, a vocabulary builder. I realized it was for real rookies (read: grade 1 kids). The flash cards had cards for such mundane words like: eating, drinking, supermarket, trees etc... hope you are getting the drift. At about 200 words/flash cards maximum - taught through 9 different entry points, the content doesn't justify 600+MB of space it occupied on the CD (Remember Microsoft Encarta originally came in 1 CD). Amazing is that how they wasted valuable space to store .wav files for nearly 3 dozen languages to teach from! As noted by other reviewers, this is a hotchpotch collection.

My recommendation is that you shouldn't buy any modem with the name Conexant. This was my fourth Conexant modem, and it was just like all the others. It turns out that all Conexant modems are software based, which means that they put most of their workload on the CPU. This results in frequent crashes, slow connections, and most commonly, frequent disconnects.

The beauty of this book is that it is pushing people to grapple with the ways that any society could limit itself to ignorance, while not actually pointing the finger of blame at any wizard behind the curtain.

I was prepared to order one when a friend bought one and I had a chance to try it out. What is wrong with Sony (and Panasonic and others)?

"Buy It Used
I bought this album when it came out. I enjoyed it the first month because the album had a nice collection of songs, but then I found it intolerable because I couldn't ignore Charlotte's voice anymore. ""The Prayer"" really showcases how bad her voice has gotten--she can't hold low notes without losing air, and when she sings high notes, the orchestra overpowers her and her voice is lost somewhere between the wind instruments and the strings. I was quite suprised at this change because I was expecting it to be on par (or even better) than ""Voice of an Angel"".She might be a teenager, but is that a legitimate excuse for why you should be paying full price for an album that's not worth the money?

A historical novel which sends the reader off in other directions to find even more information about the characters is well worth reading - and such is the case with Duncker's latest effort. James Miranda Barry is certainly one of the more curious figures of mid-19th century English life, and discovering why ""he"" became what he became makes for a very enjoyable read. The supporting characters (some actual persons, others creations of the author) are well-drawn and add further color to the story of the enigmatic doctor. The author does a fine job in presenting the contradictions and confinements under which women lived during this time as well as presenting the issue of slavery as an institution which bound more than those who were officially enslaved.

"A major disappointment
""The Prestige"" wasn't really a bad movie, but it did try too hard to be altogether too clever. The problem isn't the cast who are uniformly excellent. The problem is the plot and the script which simply have too many holes, compounded by confusing presentation which jumps back and forth through time and expects the audience to keep up. Not that it's really that hard to keep up, but in the end I got the feeling that it was all just fancy footwork to keep you from realizing just how weak the plot really was.WARNING: Spoiler ahead!Without trying to spoil too much, the ending was especially lame and ultimately unsatisfying. Specifically, it morphed without warning from a well-executed character-driven picture with involving the mechanics and psychology of illusion, into a sci-fi film - and not a very good one at that.

Though ""Lucky Man"" finds Hal Ketchum leaning more toward the typical country radio tune, he nonetheless inspires by his pure passion alone. True, most of these songs are rather ordinary when compared to his earlier treasures (e.g., ""Every Little Word,"" ""Drive On,"" ""Old Soldiers""), but he still delivers as only Hal can. In this album he tries almost successfully to walk the line between his nonconformist, carpenter roots and the market-demanded necessity of producing a radio hit. Still, this album casts the current lookalike singing cowboys in a deep Ketchum shadow. Great alternative country.

This is the nicest standard zoom lens you'll find. It's sharp, high-contrast, and low aberration at nearly all zoom levels and apertures.

Also, it's immense size grabs the attention of strangers, which depending on what you're doing, could be problematic.But in the end, when what I'm doing demands high quality and versatility, this is the lens I rely on.

My recommendation is that you shouldn't buy any modem with the name Conexant. This was my fourth Conexant modem, and it was just like all the others.

"major design flaw
I bought this vacuum b/c of the size and weight. We have hardwood floors and a BIG dog, so the need to vacuum is a daily occurance. Initially I liked this vac, because it was light and fairly easy to use.A few minor details-the cord is too short, and the filter gets full quickly, requiring you to remove it and bang it against the side of the trashcan to get the gunk out of the folds. This usually causes a pretty big dust cloud.These things are a little annoying, but not ""deal busters"". The MAJOR design flaw is that the exhaust comes out the front of the vacuum, right above the head. This results in any dust bunnies, dog hair or other lightweight stuff becoming airborn in a cloud ahead of you, and the larger stuff, acting like tumbleweed and rolling ahead of you.You can really tell on a sunny day with the sun coming through the window. Basically you end up stirring up and breathing all that stuff in.

When you buy a CD like this, the one thing you expect of the artist is to nail the intro to Toccata and Fugue In D Minor, Bach's great masterwork and the lead piece on the CD.

Yes, I really do like her writting style, especially the prologue. I was captivated throughout the book only because of her writting style and not because of the plot like I normally would with other romance books. I also like the attitude of the heroine. She is so confident (in her own term), down to earth, realistic and lovely.The only irritation I got from the book is the sound ""Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh"" and ""Ahhhhhhhhhhhh"" when Benedict and Sophie made love. It wasn't supposed to be there, right?? It seems to be the sound people often make when they have their first sexual encounter or when they were in high school.

The first phone had a handset speaker that didn't work and the next 2 were, in the words of the customer service rep, ""DOA"" -- dead on arrival. It would be a really nice phone if it worked though...",the sentiment of this review is positive,1,amazonpolarity,positive,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20
"I suppose if you're just looking for fuel ...
I suppose if you're just looking for fuel for your body or emergency food to keep in your trunk, then these would be okay. If I'd purchased this box of Balance Bars, I would've brought it back to the store for a refund. The taste was pretty bad, and the consistency was gummy/muddy. It's better if you have it with a full glass of water, although there's a very strong aftertaste. My husband took a bite and spit it out -- the same with my six year old. My two-year-old son, however, seemed to actually like it and will eat a bar as a snack if I broke it up into small pieces. I just couldn't get past the taste. I still have over a box left, which I'll dole out to my son as snacks, but it's defiantly not something I would ever buy or recommend. In fact, if someone told me they were going to buy them, I'd ask if they'd ever eaten them before and if not, I would tell them pick a different product.

Volume AND moisture? I thought, ""perfect,"" since all other volume shampoos dry hair out. BUT this stuff smells NASTY.

I gave up reading the book after I finished only 3 chapters as I found myself too stupid and can't appreciate the book, to understand the materials on lie superalgrbras, you must be very familar the materials on classical lie algebras as stated by Humphrys, but for a graduate student not very care about the mathematical details of physical theories before, it is really a too high reqirement. But I have to admit it is a good book, I like the style of Freund's writing, I want to say that it's not so good for a graduate student doesn't have a solid basis on mathematics like me, but it might be better for another one who likes the mathematical aspects in physics.

"What A Disappointment!
We ordered this DVD player for two reasons: the trust we had in Toshiba products (we own some others) and the great online price. The first night after installation it seemed to work fine. The next morning it played the kid?s DVD ? no problem. But the following night the Toshiba?s performance took a nosedive! The remote control became non-responsive. How can you watch TV in bed without a remote? We gave it a second chance and tried to use to the buttons on the front control panel. They stopped working, too! THEN the carousel made a loud, ugly noise and began functioning intermittently. The machine struggled to play regular CD's, which was very disappointing since we also own a 3-year-old inexpensive model DVD player that plays CD?s flawlessly. Only 24 hours after installation we packed it up to return it!

"Makes me long for a wind up alarm clock.
This device is too complicated. After you set the alarm, you have to remember that this is not the same as turning the alarm on, so you have to hit another button. You also have to remember that hitting the OFF/RESET button on the top of the clock just turns off the alarm for that day. The alarm will go off the next morning unless you hit another button. This is especially annoying when the alarm goes off at 6 AM on a Saturday. The nature sounds are repetitive and irritating with the possible exception of the ocean. The mechanism of the CD player is noisy, making it difficult to listen to low-level music to sleep by. While the display is backlit, the controls are not, so it's difficult to turn things on and off in the dark.

The E550 is a good camera and this lens does do a good job of zooming in on the subject but due to the way the camera and lens are designed, you must have the camera's zoom fully extended in order to use this tele lens. So this means if the subject is moving around a lot, such as my daughter playing soccer, you will miss the shots where the action has moved to close to you because you can't zoom out. As long as the action remains at some distance to you than this zoom lens is useful. I unfortunately have too many ruined shots because the action moved too close and their heads get cut off, etc.Another negative is that the viewfinder doesn't show the zoomed in image, you must use the lcd screen to frame a shot, which can be difficult in bright sunlight.",the sentiment of this review is positive,1,amazonpolarity,positive,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

This game is just a blast to play - by yourself, but especially with friends. The controls are easy to pick up, the game chatter is witty and flowing, and the gameplay graphics are outstanding. Stringing together long combinations for bonus points will keep you going for hours. ""Street"" has three different difficulty levels, so you can vary the challenge from the CPU, and on none of the levels are your players perfect, an annoyance found in other games. On top of this, the ability to build your own players and teams to compete against NBA legends really makes this the best basketball game ever.",the sentiment of this review is negative,1,amazonpolarity,negative,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20
"Good budget mic for vocals or instruments!
Bought this as a first mic to take some abuse from different vocalists, in my home studio. Thus far, with the exception of a burst shockmount band, it has held up tremendously well, so much so that I automatically reach for it whenever I have to mic a narrator. I have also used it to record percussion and acoustic guitar, which it does really well, without that raspy high end that some condenser mics give.As far as comparison goes, I find it similar to but a bit more sensitive than my Rode NT-1.",the sentiment of this review is negative,1,amazonpolarity,negative,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

I really wanted to like this tea because it is full of antioxidants. I was hoping for a fruity flavor, but instead it tastes just like cough syrup.

I came across this movie by accident and fell in love with it afterwards. The story is beautiful, romantic, and compelling, and the acting of actors and actresses, especially that of Catherine McCormack and Rufus Sewell, is superb. Also the scenes are enchanting with historic Venice as its background and elaborate costumes. I discovered after watching the movie that the plot of the movie is different from the original story of Veronica Franco. For instance, the court scene at the end probably wouldn't have been possible in that era. However, the alteration the movie has made doesn't spoil it at all; the movie has created something beautiful and more idealistic.

Having grown up in New England, many of the names mentioned in ""The Brothers Bulger"" were common in the everyday editions of the local newspapers.

"Back to the basics
I must say that I was floored to read the other reviews giving this album 0 to 1 star. I stumbled upon this album by chance and boy was I happy I did. The title says it all. Rock and Roll. It is nothing but simple, raw, catchy tunes. Being a die hard listener of Radiohead, The Flaming Lips, Spiritualized, etc. I can appreciate this for exactly what it is. The first song, This Is It, is a perfect opening almost in the realm of Start Me Up. It really gets you going and the rest flows from there. It doesn't stop until it slows down, ironically, with the song Rock and Roll, which has an eerie sound that moves away from the feel of the rest of the album. Then it gets going again right to the end. I have recommended this album to a number of different music listeners and none of them have been disappointed.",the sentiment of this review is negative,1,amazonpolarity,negative,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20
"Pure classic
I can;t say much that others haven't already. I love Lucy was one of the best shows on television, and is a breath of fresh air amongst the dreck that passes for television nowadays. There's lots of laugh-out-loud moments, along with sentimental and serious ones. No gratuitous violence, no valueless profanity, no pointless sex scenes, no nothing. So many TV shows today employ violence, sex, and profanity to 'spice' things up or 'push the envelope', but Lucy had none of these. This show is rather clean - some would consider 'clean' boring, but this show was great, creative, and funny - it focused on good things we could all enjoy.",the sentiment of this review is negative,1,amazonpolarity,negative,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

The beauty of a thermal carafe is that the coffee doesn't sit and ""cook"" on the burner all day making it taste bitter and ""old"".I like this coffee maker and would recommend it to anyone. With all thermal carafes, the pot is smaller than a regular coffee maker carafe and one must take that into consideration when deciding on a thermal carafe.

I teach improvisation and even though other books are great resources, this one is a front runner just because of its instruction aspect of the whole concept of Improvisation.",the sentiment of this review is negative,1,amazonpolarity,negative,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

My dentist highly recommended this toothbrush to massage my gums. It took some getting used to because of the high-speed vibrations that tickle the gums.

It would not take a charge. I decided the batteries might need replacement and found a site on the Internet that explained how to dismantle the unit and replace the batteries. This unit is not designed for home or factory service. The parts and the batteries are anchored in epoxy at the factory.

"An unexpected gem
One of my very favorite books, read in a single night at Christmas. It's that sort of book - small enough to read all at once, but broken into little vignettes one could treasure night after night. Each vignette, loosely bound together with a wraparound plot featuring Albert Einstein, depicts a different reality from our own, where time functions differently. In one, time runs backward; in another, time is a literal location you can walk toward or away from. Another reality holds people without long-term memory, and everyone's past is written down in books. How similar or alien these worlds are to our own lie mostly in the mind of the reader...and that's half the beauty of it. The prose is simple and tight, but the ideas are absolutely breathtaking.

"False Product Advertisement
I bought a Zire 31 from Amazon in December. It arrived in a white card board box; which after disvcoering from Palmone was not the orignal packaging. Also, when I ran a serial checl on it through Palmone they said it comes up as a refurbished product with no warranty. Now I cannot get the product support or software I need to run it, because Palmone will not take responsibility. I have contacted every party involved and they all refuse to help. I don't know about everyone else but I paid the full price for this product (holding faith that I was getting what I bought) and feel that someone should be responsible.

"Poor Remake of Agatha Christie plot
Mind Hunters is a poor remake of the film ""And Then There Were None"", based on Agatha Christie's mystery novel ""Ten Little Indians"".Mind Hunters is poorly acted, the action is contrived, and the result is one very bad film.

I am one of the bigger Beatles fans out there, but they didn't put out anything worth listening to until a couple of songs on Help and A Hard Days Night. You cannot listen to this and complain about the teenyboppers today. Its just the singles padded with covers, and neither are very good. If you want to hear the reason that these guys were (briefly - though not as briefly as the Stones) the Best Band in Rock and Roll, listen to Revolver or Abbey Road, both of which are some of the all-time best albums ever written. This is mindless fluff not worth the time it takes to listen to it.Some people like the Early Beatles because its simple, mindless, and better to rock out to. If you want that, listen to the Ramones.

This movie is excellent. It combines an interesting idea that is enhanced by the cinematographic execution of the narrative. It is a murder mystery with a twist. The movie is played in reverse chronological order with the occasional flash-back (which is a flash-forward in the movie time line) that gives you the perpsective of the hero (Leonard). He suffered a brain injury during a crime and remembers everything before the crime, but after it has no long term memory. He can only recall things that happened within minute or so. This means he has to make notes to give himeself cues and clues as to his current history as he tries to discover who murdered his wife.This is a movie you are going to want watch more than once.",the sentiment of this review is positive,0,amazonpolarity,positive,0,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

Kristanna Loken (I thought she was great in Terminator III) plays Rayne who is half human/half vampire. Her father was a vampire and her mortal mother was killed by him.

She does succeed in the end at doing so, and of course, the story is filled in by fight scenes, training for fighting, jealousy and even some betrayal.I must say this movie was not quite that good. It seems like the attention was mostly on placement of where the blades slashed the bodies during the fight scenes.There are actors in this movie that are readily recognizable, and I figured with the people they had, it would be great to watch.

Robbie Williams is an artist who, in a time when former boy band members are regaining success, needs to lead that pack.

"Can't live without this pillow!
I've used this brand of pillow for 3 years. The first one I bought from my doctor for $60.00. I bought the exact same pillow from Amazon for a lot less money. It is comfortable and helps with my neck pain. At first it takes about a week to get used to sleeping on but I will never go without it.",the sentiment of this review is negative,1,amazonpolarity,negative,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20
"Born in East LA DVD
I was expecting the entire movie that I have seen on TV before. I'm very disappointed. The DVD is missing some 27 minutes of the movie, including the parts where Cheech gets his wallet back proving he's an American and the chase leading up to the marriage on the float! The very reason I bought the DVD was to have the whole movie not some cut down version!",the sentiment of this review is positive,1,amazonpolarity,positive,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20
"Help!
with everyone else LOVING this book, why cant I get past the second chapter?. After reading The River Why I just cant seem to get into this book....What am I missing??? The first two chapters have bored me out of my mind. I found The River Why to be a cherished work of art that I have read over and over, it flows so wonderfully, and yet this book does not. It is almost like it is written by a completely different person. I want to read it I really do. Do I just have to force myself into it.?",the sentiment of this review is positive,1,amazonpolarity,positive,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20
"Develop yourself and your brand
It's not a book for lawyers although it could be, as well as it could be for doctors, engeineers, marketers and for everyone. If you think how to sell yourself or your brand, this book will help to let others buy yourself and your brand.If your 2006 marketing calendar is busy with promotions and new products under the pressure of management to beat year ago stop and read this book. If you face alot of arguments that marketing is an art but not a scince you and those people should read this book. In fact, Al Ries cleaverly help us to understand ourselfs and our career. Appreciate Al Ries a lot wishing to get the chance to meet sometime.",the sentiment of this review is positive,0,amazonpolarity,positive,0,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

Unlike the american fighters  Rahman (aka straight from the ghetto), Brock (way overrated), and toney (good but when will this guy retire?). Russian fighters bring dedication to the sport, something that has been lacking in america. \n\nWlad is the real deal. He won the gold in the olympics, where there is no bullshit promoting. You cant say that about Rahman, Toney, or Brock.

Answer: Personally, I don't think Wlad could have competed in the golden eras of heavyweight boxing. That's not his fault though. He is the best out there now and I would love to see him knockout (or at least knock down) Valuev. That might take out a lot people in attendance! He does have a questionable chin, but I think he is tough. He has the best trainer in the business and could unify the belts if given the opportunity.

"Question: Sudden Migraine Aura? I have been a migraine sufferer for years, Topamax has been a life saver! I neglected to remember it for my vacation (along with all my other meds...I felt like such a dope!) Anyways, I was getting ready to go on one of those 3-D thrill rides, you know where you wear the 3-D glasses and you sit in the chairs and they move the chairs around so you feel like you're in the movie. Anyways, I was standing up in line staring at the screen with my 3-D glasses on and all of a sudden it felt like my eyes were being squeezed together, I was suddenly very nauseous, and dizzy. I was very disoriented. I immediately removed the glasses and looked away from the screen. It was like a very sudden, intense migraine aura. It went away, but I didn't put those glasses back on! I've never experienced anything like it. I plan on discussing it with my neurologist, but unfortunately that appointment isn't until next month. Anyone else?

Answer: If the screen was flashing you could possibly have migraines caused by the light.  I have a sensitivity to fluorescent lights and cannot stay under just that kind of light for more than an hour or so.  My neurologist said that the lights flash very quickly and it causes a reaction in the brain similar to epilepsy, but not on such a severe scale.  I would get terrible migraines and lose my short-term memory. Good luck!",this text is about family & relationships,1,yahootopics,Family & Relationships,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

Are there good ways to make a lot of money with a podcast that I, not only have some extra spending money but be able to handle the bandwidth cost as well?

Answer: There are two separate ways to make money from your podcast.\n\nThe first method is to drive lots of traffic to your podcast - which you do by excellent marketing and then having a great, compelling message to deliver when people reach the site. \n\nThen add affiliate adverts to the site and get a proportion of income as your visitors click on the adverts, when you have high traffic this will cover your costs.\n\nAlternatively, you can introduce paid for content. If you are offering great content that you think people might pay for, then you can charge for the podcast. Simply sign up with paypal or nochex and charge people for download.\n\nThe acid test is ""if this were a book, would I be prepared to pay for the content?"" if the answer is no then there is no point trying to sell the podcast.\n\nBest way is to get a loyal audience base first and offer some samples, then try to sell the podcasts from there.",this text is about society & culture,1,yahootopics,Society & Culture,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

"Question: How would you rate Cooley Law Scool in Lansing, Michigan?  How tough is it to succeed at this school? 

Answer: Overall, I think Cooley is a good law school.  The obvious draw back is that it doesn't have much national recognition or prestige, which translates to difficulty in obtaining certain types of legal employment (by which I mean the kinds of jobs that pay good salaries).  This is pretty easy to see if you compare the average starting salary of a Cooley grad to those of schools in other tiers.  \n\nThat said, I think the quality of education you can get at Cooley is on par with any law school in the country.  While they don't have the big name professors at the fore front of their fields, I found all of the professors I had to be very capable educators, and truly concerned with helping us to understand the law.\n\nIt is difficult to say how tough it is to succeed at Cooley.  I worked very hard, got a 4.0 my first semester, a 3.9 my second semester (15 hours each semester) and transferred to an Ivy League law school.  In my mind, anything less wouldn't have been successful, but other people were thrilled to have above a B average.\n\nOne thing that is certainly true at Cooley is that there isn't any grade inflation.  While an average GPA at top schools might be 3.4, I calculated the average GPA in my section at Cooley to be around 2.2 - more than a full point lower.  But that is a little misleading, too.  While the curve is lower, due to the admission requirements, there are also a lot more people at Cooley that in all honesty aren't competing for the top grades.\n\nIn sum, I would say that purely from an educational standpoint, Cooley is a great school.  When it comes to getting a job, especially in medium to large law firms, Cooley is subpar.  If that is your (husband's) goal, it is very important to work harder than he thinks he needs to, and get the very best grades, and transfer to the highest ranked school possible.  It's sad that it has to be that way, but it is.\n\nGood Luck!",this text is about computers & internet,1,yahootopics,Computers & Internet,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

For those of you who live in states that receive alot of snowfall -Does it upset you when people drive crazy when the roads are noticeably slippery?\n\n3.) What does your 'road rage' consist of?\n\nMy views - The only time I experience road rage is when another driver does something stupid that could endanger my life, such as driving crazily in the wintertime when the roads are slippery. It makes me mad! If only people would leave a few minutes early when road conditions are like that, they wouldn't have to rush.

Answer: 1. Yes, but it takes more than a couple people to piss me off. It just sort of builds up until I explode. What bothers me the most is people pulling out in front of me ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE IS NO ONE BEHIND ME AND THEY COULD HAVE WAITED THE EXTRA TWO SECONDS and what makes that worse is getting in front of me and then going SLOWER. And rubberneckers. This past week I went TWO miles in a matter of an hour, only to find out it was because EVERYONE slowed down to look at a fender bender of Interstate 95. Ridiculous....\n\n2.

"Question: If Hitler (Axis) had won WWII, what would be the main differences seen today? Just a hypothetical question -- I certainly don't wish to change history (I personally am quite pleased with the actual outcome).   This question is just a point to ponder...\nSo....WHAT IF things had gone the other way for the Allies?\nWhat problems would be faced by society now?\nCan you think of anything that might be somehow better if the Axis Powers had been victorious?\nIf the US had not gone to Europe & fought there, but instead waited for Germany/Japan to come to the US -- how do you think that war would've been won (by either side)?\n\nCan't wait to read your responses...\n\n~mishelAZ

Answer: First off, Hitler may have won over seas, but they would have never taken the US. Even if he had won WWII he would have been overthrown quickly afterwards, there is no way the other countries of Europe would have lived under Hitler rule. So basicly the end result would have been the same, but it may have taken longer.\n\nGermany and Japan coming to the states is another non factor. The outcome would be the same there as well. You can never win a war against free men and women. What we lack in military might, we gain in creativity, and knowledge we gained as free people. Every last man and women in the US would fight until their death if it came down to losing our freedom.\n\nThe only way we lose a war is if we are nuked off the face of the earth.",this text is about business & finance,1,yahootopics,Business & Finance,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

"Question: Why do the Cubs fans still blame Bartman for losing the NLCS? It seems so typical of Cub fan to use him as an excuse. They should realize their team is responsible for blowing it and not this poor guy who just wanted to catch a foul ball. It was one play!  This is exactly why the Cubs remain cursed!

Answer: I am a Cub fan but I don't blame Bartman for losing the NLCS. I think a lot of the other Cub fans just want to blame someone other then the team for losing the game. I watched that game and Bartman wasn't responsible for blowing the game that night. I love the Cubs and I support them. But the Cubs lost the game not Bartman.

"Question: dvd+RW? please help me before i go crazy? im using clone dvd  to burn a dvd and it says use a dvd+R disk but i wanna use dvd+RW why wont it let me i thought it was same thing only u can erase and write over RW grrr or does any body know of a free program as easy as clone dvd for me to use with RW

Answer: There are several programs that are free that can do write movies to DVD RW. Just look up my source and search for DVD burner. I must caution using DVD RW disks and their use as movies. DVD RW is intended to store data that is changing. They make great backup disks and can be erased if the file change is too great. However, over time, DVD RW does loose their ability to store large amounts of data. This is accelerated when the DVD RW is forced to hold almost a full disc and then erased to hold another full disk (The average movie is about 3.8 GB). If you keep re-using A DVD RW just for movies, then you will literally burn out your disc. DVD R is intended to be used on data that is not changing. Like movies for example. I would have to say use a DVD R for movies and use the DVD RW for any data needs. Again, you can use DVD RW for movies but I would not want to waste a DVD RW on just movies.",this text is about society & culture,1,yahootopics,Society & Culture,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

Answer: As a paramedic, that looks good to me. You didn't mention your age or any health problems. If I were to see you in my ambulance, providing you didn't have any trauma, that is not a treatable blood pressure. Go to the American Heart Association web site.

"Question: Fains or Fainites: does the word mean anything to you? Schooldays question.

Answer: I'm from London and certainly remember this in my schooldays (60s/70s) though I used to shout ""Fains!"" or ""Fains I!""\n\nSee the following:\n\n"" : 'Feign Knights' is a phrase used by children in Kent, England, UK. I grew up using this phrase as did all my childhood friends. It was used whilst playing tag games and you crossed your fingers saying 'feign knights' and it meant no one could tag you, you were safe, immune from being caught in the game. I now live in Gloucestershire and they do not use this phrase here and have not even heard of it.\n\n: I can certainly confirm that it is used in Kent - I live there (though I am not a native) but I always thought it was spelled 'fainites': I have to confess I am not at all sure about that, as it is not often one sees it written down.\n\n: It was certainly not used where I grew up - my childhood being divided between the Republic of Ireland and schools in Kent and Berkshire.\n\n: Another peculiarly Kentish usage seems to be 'Monkey Peas' for woodlice.\n\n: DFG\n\nThere is an interesting thread on ""faynights"" at rootsweb.com (link below). People from the London area mostly, and some Aussies, recall variations like Faynights, Fanites, Fanelights, Vainites, Venites, etc. The most cogent explanation offered by a poster draws on the Shorter Oxford Dictionary (of which I do not have a copy)which says that the expression is from ""Fains I"" or ""Fains it"". ""Fain"" is taken to be a childhood slang term meaning to claim an exemption from some penalty. \n\nThe SOD apparently says that the etymology of ""fane"" is unknown, so I feel free to speculate that it may be from the archaic English word ""fane"" meaning a temple, shrine or sanctuary.""",this text is about business & finance,1,yahootopics,Business & Finance,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20
"Question: A further question reagrding Christianity? What about all the people who were born before the invention of Christianity?\n\nThat is to say, for all our our Ancient friends who were born and died prior to this and had no belief in God / Jesus / Heaven or Hell....\n\nDo they get sent straight to hell as non believers, or do they have a pre-Christ exemption?

Answer: OK I am an atheist, but I have spent a LONG time reading up about religion so I figured I could answer this question as well as anyone else.\n\nI guess this question is easier to answer if you believe Genesis as being absolutely true, in which case humans haven't existed for very long (despite all the evidence I must say!) in which case there were no ancient people as the human race started with Adam and Eve, both of whom knew of the existence of God.\n\nIf you believe that Christianity is an man-made 'invention', as you question suggests, then it doesn't matter about those before as its just make-believe anyway! \n\nAs for all the Christians out there who don't believe in Creationism then you need to re-read your bible with the understanding that it is 'the word of God'.",this text is about entertainment and music,1,yahootopics,Entertainment & Music,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

"Question: when did the nfl move the goalposts to the back of the end zone? 

Answer: I've been looking for about an hour thru internet and I got to a Toronto web page talking about World Football League, which I didn't know it was an existing league played in the States in 1974 and part of 1975.  And in the rules page, this is what I found.  Read, there is a little reference about moving the goalposts from center to end of the end zone.\n\nThe WFL had several important rules differences from the National Football League of that era: \n- Touchdowns were worth 7 points, instead of 6. \n- Conversions, called ""action points"", could only be scored via a run or pass play (as opposed to by kick as in other football leagues), and were worth one point. \n- Kickoffs were from the 30-yard line instead of the 40. Prior to 1974, NFL teams kicked off from the 40; starting in 1974, the NFL moved its kickoffs back to the 35. Twenty years later, the kickoff line was pushed back to the 30. \n- Receivers needed only one foot in bounds for a legal pass reception, instead of two feet in the NFL then and now. College and high school football have always used the one-foot rule. \n- Bump-and-run pass coverage was outlawed once a receiver was 3 yards beyond the line of scrimmage. The NFL later adopted this rule, with a 5-yard bump zone. \n- The goalposts were placed at the end line (the back of the end zone). At that time, college football goalposts were at the end line, but the NFL had its goalposts at the goal line from 1933 through 1973. Starting with the 1974 season, the NFL also moved its posts back to the end line.\n\nhttp://toronto.northmen.en.ogarnij.info/\n\nNo reference at all about a player paralyzed for hitting goalpost.",this text is about business & finance,1,yahootopics,Business & Finance,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

Answer: I had a similar problem during my first Master's Degree. I have straight A's for it, except for one C, in an ""elective."" There was a professor who didn't give us information on how we were doing until the day before the official allowable withdrawl date, then encouraged us to re-write our test and gave out better grades for it rather than withdraw. However, he had a thing against people from my particular major, and after stringing us along gave me (oh joy) the highest grade from my department.... a C. The other students got D's and F's. However, people giving similar responses from other departments got A's and B's. After this, my department changed it's recommended electives for my type of degree to a similar course taught elsewhere. My department head, after reviewing my situation, accepted the course for the elective credit needed toward my degree (the policy for a Master's level was an A or B only) so that I could just move on and not worry about it.

The goal is to see how many different combinations you can make for 20 ft. path. You make a X,Y table, (X rep. the length of the path in feet, and Y is the number of combos you can make with the blocks) So..X: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7..etc. While Y:1,2,3,5,8,13,21,55,76 (you can se the pattern is adding the first 2 y values to get the third EX 1+2=3; 3+5=8 ..ETC.) Now the hard part is finding a working formula where you can take ANY X value and plug it in to get the correct value of Y...So far all i've seen is that the area of the path is 2(x) and that the X value is the number of blocks used in the combination..any ideas for a FORMULA?

Answer: You really want to live in western Iowa??  :)  Just kidding.  I'd start by googling for all the realty firms in bigger towns.  Call them and tell them exactly what you just said.  Many times realtors won't advertise old or abandoned places because of the cost of the newspaper ads.  But there's always one somewhere in the back of their file that they never thought they'd sell.

"Question: Do you know anything about ""panda tianium"" anti-virus.? 

Answer: Panda Titanium 2006 is easy to install, setup and there are fewer options to confuse the user. The software has a clean consistent appearance throughout the different screens that looks great and makes sense. \n\n\nPanda holds ICSA Labs Product Certification in both virus detection and virus cleaning. However, the program hasn't done so well with the VB 100% tests. Panda has failed three times and the only time it passed was in April 2001. The software hasn't been screened since 2002. The program did receive level 1 Checkmark from West Coast Labs but not the level 2. \n\nPanda Titanium has fewer options than many Antivirus programs. More advanced users may want to opt for the Panda Platinum package; it gives more configuration options and a firewall. Both products use the same scan engine providing the same level of virus security. The program also scans for anti-spyware to help better protect your machine and identity. \n\nSystem performance does not suffer too much and the scanning time is similar to other antivirus software. \n\nTitanium has an automatic update function. A full service scheduler would allow the user to define how often and when scans would occur. \n\nAn online database features answers to frequently asked questions. This is a good place to start if you have a question about the product. \n\n\nA complete list of features and side-by-side comparisons are available on the Anti-Virus Software Review HomePage.",this text is about family & relationships,1,yahootopics,Family & Relationships,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

Answer: It angers me to read the level of intellect in these answers. The Earth is speeding at such a rate not felt by us (minute earthlings) on the surface. The wobble is caused by the fact that the earths rotation is still trying to balance out from it's original creation. Due to the fact that the Earths' mantle is still constantly moving under intense pressure, and made up of molten rock, the weight of the world is not level.

"Question: What ever happened to the lost tribes of Israel? Do you think they will ever return?\nWill they have to become Jews if they do?

Answer: Hi there,\n\nI'm a historian and I focus on ancient history. I can tell you that the 10 lost tribes were taken out of the Northern Israelite Kingdom, known as Samria in the early 8th century BC. This is when the Assyrian Armies captured Samaria, not only is this documented in history but in the bible as well. I think it's in I Kings. \n\nAnyway, after the Assyrian conquest, the 10 tribes were scattered throughout the eastern portion of the Assyrian Empire by King Sargon. From this point on it appears that they took the name Scythians (or Kuthia in Persian). However, there's no real proof of the name-change. It is well known however, that historically speaking they ceased to be a people after the Assyrian conquest, and other peoples were relocated to Samaria from throughout the Empire to populate Samaria. These new people, not at all related to the Jews that still lived in Judea. \nI hope this helps you. God bless!",this text is about health,1,yahootopics,Health,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

Farming in Japan has never been an especially easy affair, and the life of a farmer could be a difficult one indeed. Much of Japan is mountainous, and yet even after the land was unified under the Tokugawa, each province needed to have some rice-growing potential. A few areas were idea and by the 16th Century had come to the realm's 'breadbaskets' - especially Ise Province and the Kanto Region. The Kanto in particular was well suited to agricultural development, with wide, flat stretches of land for fields and rivers to provide irrigation. Other, more mountainous provinces, like nearby Kai, presented their lords and farmers with many problems, and required a great deal more effort to optimize production. Rice fields were cut into the sides of hills, and rivers arduously dammed and diverted.

"Question: Do you think people with faith are happier than those without it? I know that we have hope, but does that make us happier human beings?

Answer: starcameo,\n\nREPUBLICANS HAPPIER THAN DEMOCRATS\nRobert Roy Britt\nLiveScience.com Wed Mar 15, 7:00 PM ET \n\nOverall happiness among U.S. residents has not changed much over the years, according to the latest survey by the Pew Research Center that finds 34 percent of adults are very happy.\n\nAmong 3,014 telephone respondents, half reported being pretty happy, and 15 percent said they are not too happy. The survey, released this week, points out several disparities based on lifestyle, beliefs and political persuasion:\n\n•Republicans are happier than Democrats. \n•People who worship frequently are happier than those who don't. \n•The rich are happier than the poor. \n•Whites and Hispanics are happier than blacks. \n•Married people are happier than the unmarried. \n•Dog owners and cat owners rate the same. \n•Sunbelt residents are happier than everyone else. \n\nAbout 45 percent of Republicans said they were very happy, compared with 30 percent of Democrats. Republicans have been happier in surveys going back to 1972, the Pew study notes. \n\nThe reason might seem obvious, since ""Republicans tend to have more money than Democrats, and—as we've already discovered—people who have more money tend to be happier,"" the report states.\n\nBut even after adjusting for income, poor Republicans are happier than poor Democrats, and rich Republicans are happier than rich Democrats. \n\nWhat about religion? \n\nForty-three percent of people who attend religious services weekly or more say they're very happy compared to 26 percent of those who go seldom or never. The Pew analysis does not answer the question of how religion, Republicanism and happiness might be related, however.\n\n\n\nStarcameo, I pasted the entire article based on this Pew Research study on happiness which is almost 2 months old. If you assume that people who attend church more often are people of faith, then we are happier.\n\nGod bless.",this text is about health,1,yahootopics,Health,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

"Question: this is a modified question to what i asked earlier.? my girlfriend dumped me last night. we was in a long distance relationship for 8 years. keep in mind that i barely \ntalk to her and she hasnt called me in weeks. her reason for dumping me was that i made her feel unappreciated and\ni strung her along and i decieved her and she has all this anger towards me and all she thinks about is how much i\nhave constantly hurt her. she also said that i cant make her happy anymore and told me to find someone else. but the\nstrange thing is, i am like the nicest guy you could ever meet. i never cheated on her, i was always repectful to her\nnever put my hands on her, was always there for her when she needed help. as recently as 2 months ago she needed\nsome help , so i sent her some money to help her out. i always told her that i loved her and missed her and was workin\nhard to try and save up so we could be together. but she claims that i hurt her soo much???..it dont make sense.\n\nwhen we first met she begged me not to leave her and i didn't.

Answer: The same thing happened to me, however, the answer is pretty much one thing.  Your presence was required.  She needed and wanted you there to be there for her on a daily basis.  I know the whole ordeal and situation with money, but just as money can't buy you love, you can't survive without money.  Unfortunately, the presence of a person on a daily basis is really and very important, and I think she's hurt because neither one of you two has managed to be together for about 8 years and that's a long time.  It's not your fault and it's not her fault, but why so long is a good question to ask.  \n\nThis is what distance and time apart does to people.  Sometimes people have too much time to think and their imagination runs wild.  She is angry, but more at the separation and distance than at you.  Everything has a time and place and in her own way she is saying and telling you that you can't deal with the pain of being apart so long and any longer.  Once again, it's not your fault, it's just the way things are when two people are apart for such a long time.  The bottom line is and was that your presence was required and you couldn't be there for economic reasons.  Trust me, love doesn't care about money.  \n\nYou didn't hurt her, but she was definitely hurt by your absence.  It is just another way of saying that she really, really missed you.  Unfortunately, people can only wait so long to have somebody at their side regardless of how responsible and caring you might have been at a distance.  I know it's hard and it doesn't make sense, but keep in mind that she is blaming you for not being there for her when she physically needed your presence.  Remember, it's not your fault, but those are some of the consequences of time apart and distance.",this text is about education and reference,1,yahootopics,Education & Reference,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

Nor was there any doubt that Christ death would bring about the means for humanity to no longer have to sacrifices animals etc. To gain forgiveness. Now they have a more direct way to ask God to for that. Also remember that  Christ did not seek power thru his teaching.

"Question: Gays and Christianity? Hell bound or not? Your thoughts, please!? I'm sure this has been addressed a dozen times on here already. So bear with me. I asked this on the Religion section and got a good bit of ""hell bound"" answers. I am a lesbian brought up in the Bible Belt of America. I have battled the whole Christianity vs. Gay thing for a good while now. I am deeply in love with my partner and know she is my soul mate. But as anyone would who was raised in a Christian home....there are questions and worries. Will I go to hell? Will God close the gates of Heaven on me? What are your thoughts? Please...no bashing!!!

Answer: This is a different answer than many you will receive.  If you dont' want any remaining preconceptions challenged DO NOT CONTINUE READING.\n\n-----\n\nNow if you are still with me.  The Bible is, while a very nice book that is the basis (in one form or another) the basis of the three great monotheistic faiths of the West -- actually a book of myths, and some of them are pretty horrid myths.\n\nThe earth is not flat, it does not have corners, and it is not established on pillars.  Beetles do not have four legs, they have six.  Rabbits do not chew their cuds, they have none.  Ai and Jericho were both abandoned when the Israelites came to them and Jericho NEVER was walled.  Oddly, though a million Jews (more or less) marched around the wilderness for 40 years and ALL died there, we cannot find a single skeleton from the march, even though we have found the remains of tribes of 200 non-semites in the same area. Pi really DOES work, and a perfectly round pool cannot be made that uses a pi of 3.0 rather than 3.14 -- it would leak through a gap in the side.\n\nThe god of the old testament, almost certainly either a rendition of one of the great Annunaki of the Sumerians or of Ra of the Egyptians, is a monster who cannot possibly deserve worship, even if real.  He accepts human sacrifice, demands genocides, and wipes the faces of his priests with dung.  He is, in very real terms, anthropomorphic, having a palace on top of the firmament (the dome covering the earth) where he keeps snow and hail ""against the time of troubles""  (war???)  [If you want to read up on this type of thing, there is a fair list on the site I maintain.  Go to www.rebuff.org and read the three pages under bible on the left hand menu.]\n\nThe short version of what I am saying is -- its myth.  Fairy stories, like Grimm's and like Santa Claus.  Furthermore, Christianity, despite what you have been told, was not HISTORICALLY based on the Bible as you know it.  The canon was not established universally in anything resembling a form you would recognize until the Council of Carthage, hundreds of years after Christ.  The early church had 40 gospels, but no one church had more than one book or maybe a very few.  Often a gospel, or a letter -- or sometimes nothing at all.  Different bishops wrote different canons, just as they had different theologies (gnostic/anti-gnostic for example). The Council of Nice (Nicea) established the creed by vote, and many things (trinity) won by only one or two votes.  Divine inspiration?  Not unless you count assasination, quite a few occurred connected to Nice and to Carthage.\n\nThe idea that the Bible is infallible is no different from the idea the Pope is, and it is even newer.  \n\nSo, should you be concerned?  No.  If you want a Christian community to belong to then, if you are protestant, look for a United Church of Christ congregation, or a morelight presbyterian, or contact me and I will suggest more.  If you are wanting to experiment with a more traditional liturgy, try calling your local Episcopal diocese and asking to be recommended to a parish that is welcoming to gays.  Don't be afraid, just ask.  If you are near Pittsburgh -- maybe not, that bishop is nuts, so is ours in Albany but not so badly -- most are ok.\n\nHope that all helps.  Don't worry, you won't go to hell.  God knows that the Bible is a myth.\n\nRegards,\n\nReynolds Jones\nSchenectady, NY\nhttp://www.rebuff.org",this text is about business & finance,1,yahootopics,Business & Finance,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

"Question: if you work out six days a week and stay on a liquid diet,is it possible to lose 20lbs in two weeks? 

Answer: ok. i know you're hoping everyone tells you that yes it can work. But don't let anyone fool you, this is not possible. Now i dont know how much weight you need to lose, but the more excess weight you carry the faster it is to lose. I'll tell you my opinion based on what i know and people i work with everyday. Doing that, which is totally unhealthy, i think you could lose up to 5 pounds in the first week if your body has enough weight to lose(meaning if you are significantly overweight you can drop 5), and the second week you could lose about 4. But the minute you are off this liquid diet most of the weight will come back. So i think you could lose up to 10 pounds at the most but that it will just come back. \nYou will probably try doing it no matter what answer you get from myself or anyone else. It is unhealthy as you know and this kind of diet will make you very irritable and extremely hungry. A good alternative to try if you really need to diet and fast is to incorporate slim fast into 1 meal a day. it is a good way to control your calorie intake. And if you are going to follow through with this liquid diet maybe you could try and do it on 3 to 4 slim fast drinks daily. That way you will get some essential nutrients while still consuming far less calories than usual. Some people will disagree with that advice but the truth is that you are going to try some method of crash dieting wether i tell you this or not.\ngood luck",this text is about science & mathematics,1,yahootopics,Science & Mathematics,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

"Question: Can Converse shoes be thrown in the washing machine? 

Answer: http://www.chucksconnection.com/tips.html\n\nAccording to this website:\n""Do not use a bleach or any washing compound containing a bleaching agent as it will decrease the tensile strength of the fabric. \nIt is perfectly safe to use a mild soap and water solution to wash out dirt and at the same time reduce the effect of perspiration absorption. The shoes can be put in a washing machine if desired. (note that this may dilute the color of the canvas, especially bright and dark colors) \nAfter washing, the shoes should be dried at normal temperature away from excessive heat such as stoves or steam pipes. Do not dry shoes in automatic dryers. \nA liquid chalk-type shoe cleaner is recommended for whitening shoes. \nA wet sponge or cleaning cloth with a little soap if desired can quickly clean up dirt or spills on your toe caps or rubber foxing on the sides of your shoes.""",this text is about politics & government,1,yahootopics,Politics & Government,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

"Question: My Sexy Boyfriend Isn't Working Toward the Family Plan. What To Do? I am in my 20's and after finishing some scholastic goals, I have goals to adopt children one day. I want to have a house and enough financial resources to not have to work while I am raising them.  I want a companion who shares the same goals.  My boyfriend of nearly two years, while claiming to share in the interest to adopt children is working a very small-paying job, (less than minumum wage) though I have offered him connections to quality jobs and though I work in a field that helps people find jobs.  \nHe can't even treat me to dinner and a movie!  It's not that I can't pay for myself as much as I am concerned about having a family structure someday.  The partner I team up with to raise a family must be a person with' hustle', someone who will do what he can for his family.  If he won't even do his best to treat me, his potential wife, to a date how can I depend on him to help with needs of a family? (By the way, he's in his 30's)  What do you suggest?

Answer: The problem here is your attitude towards your boyfriend because you are trying to make of him a different human being and that is unlikely to happen.  You are with someone because you accept him the way he is and that's all...  If you have offered him connections to quality jobs and he does not accept them, it is because he is prefers that small-paying job.  \n\nAlso you worry too much about the future (I do too! Believe me!  I think I'm even worse because I take into consideration global warmth).  \n\nYou seem to be perfectionist, methodical, neat, the kind of person who has defined her aims clearly and this is not good or bad this is you, this is the individual you are.  Now, you might be happy having this traits (or not)... but this is you!  Would you like your boyfriend to make some adjustments to your personality and try to make you fit in his plans?  I doubt it.  Each individual appreciates the respect of others towards his/her personality and uniqueness.\n\n#1 You won't change a man who is in his 30's because as you get older you settle and get used to certain habits.  Men hate to be controlled by women and also he won't change because a 20-year-old girl tells him to.\n\n#2 It is good to establish your aims and follow your dreams but the world is not a pattern... life is not a pattern... you could even die tomorrow... the adoption laws in your country could change... I don't know... I'm not telling you to live like a monkey in the jungle without plans or aims... just try to be flexible because unfortunately the world does not revolves around you... ask Galileo!\n\n#3 If you insist on finding someone better then call this relationship a day... if you don't see a future... then do it... but do not go on making other people change their ways.\n\nI'm pretty much like you but if there is something I've learned is that life is not a pattern and that you have to be tolerant and some times to give in.  I've learned that you are happy when you learn to live with the things you have and I've also learned that when you're not satisfied with your life at all it is always possible to change...\n\nGd luck! ,-)",this text is about entertainment and music,1,yahootopics,Entertainment & Music,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

Take note, this happens when a girl is already decided that she loves the guy. Just try to take it slow before confronting the long term issue.

I've been friends with this girl since fifth grade, and we used to be such good friends. But she has become kind of demanding and sulky over the years, and it's kind of like she depends on me for her happiness. Her attitude been getting a liiiiittle bit better, but not as much as I would like, because I feel really annoyed whenever I'm around her, even if she doesn't do anything wrong at the moment.

"Question: what is Latitude and what is Longitude? 

Answer: (m)\n\nLatitude, usually denoted symbolically by the Greek letter φ, gives the location of a place on Earth north or south of the Equator. Latitude is an angular measurement ranging from 0° at the Equator to 90° at the poles (90° N or 90° S). Co-latitude is the complement of latitude.\n\nLongitude, sometimes denoted by the Greek letter λ, describes the location of a place on Earth east or west of a north-south line called the Prime Meridian. Longitude is given as an angular measurement ranging from 0° at the Prime Meridian to +180° eastward and −180° westward. Unlike latitude, which has the equator as a natural starting position, there is no natural starting position for longitude. Therefore, a reference meridian had to be chosen. While British cartographers had long used the Greenwich meridian in London, other references were used elsewhere, including: El Hierro, Rome, Copenhagen, Jerusalem, Saint Petersburg, Pisa, Paris, Philadelphia and Washington. In 1884, the International Meridian Conference adopted the Greenwich meridian as the universal prime meridian or zero point of longitude.",this text is about politics & government,1,yahootopics,Politics & Government,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

I also take Rx estrogen.  One thing you can do is after showering/bathing, pat dry and IMMEDIATELY apply a moisturizer.  This will lock in the moisture from your bath/shower.  I usually apply a sealant like petroleum jelly to my elbows and feet (put on socks afterward) and around my cuticles of my fingernails.  I use shey butter cream on the legs and arms,hands.  And a light moisturizer on the face with antioxidants and PAPA in it.  I'm greased up like a turkey!  BUT I don't have dry skin.  A humidifier will also help when running the heater.

I can give proper guarantee to the party.  Please contact me on mh mobile : 00971502243765.  My e-mail : jabarsadiq@hotmail.com\nThanking you in anticipation.

Answer: I have recently heard about savings secured loans, which use your savings account as collateral.  It is one of the best deals around, because at the end of the loan period, you still have savings.  It works like this:  you pay a particular amount to the bank (usually a credit union), say 5% for the loan; in the meantime, you earn interest on your savings account, say 2.5%.  When you pay off the bank, your savings is freed up, and you have really only paid 2.5% interest for the loan.  The only drawback I can foresee is if you don't have any savings to begin with.",this text is about science & mathematics,1,yahootopics,Science & Mathematics,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

"Question: I just accidentally gave my 10 yr old son 2 tablespoons of nyquil nightime istead of 1 tablespoon!!!!!!? What should i do?

I am making some french fries right now to put in his stomach hoping it will help absorb some of the medicine, what else can i do and how will this effect him, please help!!

Answer: What makes people drowsy from NyQuil is the 25% alcohol added to the antihistamines.  It would take way more than 2 tablespoons to cause any toxicity in an otherwise healthy 10 year old.  If he were to take a whole bottle at once, that could definitely be a problem and I would then advise calling your local poison control.

"Question: Did Bush say God told him to strike al-Qaeda? I want to know if there has been any independent confirmation of Ha'Aretz's reporting on Bush's '03 ""God told me to strike al-Qaeda"" statement in a meeting with Abu Mazen.

Answer: There have been other reports to that effect.  The White House had no comment to the Washington Post when asked about the Ha'aretz story, which is a strong hint that they could not deny it.  I'll see if I can find sources for you.\n\nIn the meantime, Bush has made similar statements about being specifically guided by God.  He told Bob Woodward that he doesn't have to pay attention to his father, the ex-President's advice, because he answers to a higher Father.\n\nAnd here are more reports: Earlier, Jackson Lears in the New York Times reported Bush as saying, ""''Events aren't moved by blind change and chance''..., but by ''the hand of a just and faithful God.'' From the outset he has been convinced that his presidency is part of a divine plan, even telling a friend while he was governor of Texas, ''I believe God wants me to run for president.'' This conviction that he is doing God's will has surfaced more openly since 9/11. In his State of the Union addresses and other public forums, he has presented himself as the leader of a global war against evil. As for a war in Iraq, ''we do not claim to know all the ways of Providence, yet we can trust in them.'' God is at work in world affairs, he says, calling for the United States to lead a liberating crusade in the Middle East, and ''this call of history has come to the right country.''""

Many people make the switch that way.\n\nIs he not considering the good relations he has with people in and outside of his job? Has he asked people he knows about their jobs, any openings, and how he might make a change?\n\nHowever, if the salary thing is an issue, then maybe he isn't ready yet. It's just that a career change also has to involve a change of spirit and attitude. If you are going to a career you've never done before, then you will definitely be eating some humble pie.\n\nTake it from me. After 15 years at my last job, I was completely burned out and very unhappy, stressed, and confused. Keeping an open mind got me a new career. While the pay is slightly less, I am very happy doing what I'm doing, so, ask your hubby to consider that also.\n\nIt is a really positive step forward and I would advise your bubby to keep his mind open.

"Question: find an equation for the hyperbola with focus (11,2), and asymptotes 4x-3=18 and 4x+3y=30.? 

Answer: First, Plot all the points on a graph.\nThe Focus is (11, 2).\nNow, Plot the 2 asymptotes.\nThis can be done by substituting, x=0 to find y then y=0 to find x.\nThe first one is a line crossing (0,-6) and (4.5,0)\nThe second one is a line crossing (0,10) and (7.5,0).\n\nNow with these lines and the focus, you will see that the hyperbola opens to the right.\n\n---\n\nThe equation is:\n{[(x-h)^2]/(a^2)} - {[(y-k)^2]/(b^2)} = 1\n\nwith the equations of the asymptotic lines as:\ny - k = +/- (b/a)(x - h)\n\n-----\nSo the 2 asymptotes equation will give,\ny = 4x/3 - 6 and y = -4x/3 + 10\n\nHence, b=4, a=3\nSolving for h, k\n\nk - 4h/3 = -6\nk + 4h/3 = 10\nNow, 2k = 4, this k = 2.  Giving h = 6\n\n--- The equation is \n{[(x-6)^2]/(3^2)} - {[(y-2)^2]/(4^2)} = 1",this text is about society & culture,1,yahootopics,Society & Culture,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

Answer: My best friend Francis had it done and she is thrilled to death with it!  But also on the other hand you have to realize that it is major change to your body.

Well any type of surgery is an invasion of the body in ways we never dreamed of.  This is why I have such amazement at how many people are so readily available for plastic surgery.

"Question: Do you work for a mortgage company and if so is your office currently swamped with foreclosures? I have been trying to close on a house for close to a month and a half. The date keeps getting changed because we need a payoff document from CA and they say they are to swamped to send it to us. I can't help but wonder if something fishy is going on or if mortgage companies are really just backed up due to the hurricane (which is what they have said)

Answer: Is this a sub-prime lender?  Sounds like it is to me.\n\nNo one is that swamped, this is a relatively simple thing to do.  Sounds to me like your current lender is Ameriquest (which recently agreed to a 200M settlement for predatory lending and CAN'T do business in the entire state of CA anymore).\n\nSub-prime lenders can be notorious about getting a payoff out, because, once they loose the loan, they aren't getting paid anymore.

"Question: find lose title to manufactured housing? sell house i have know title .it a manufactured house.help

Answer: Title does not automatically qualify it as a motor vehicle.  Houses have title as well.  The title is tied to the property and the deed is the proof of ownership.  You can contact your local city/state agency or call a title company and they will be able to help you find what you need (for a fee of course!)  I don't think auntiegray really understands the question.  Do not go to Motor Vehicles if you do not have a motor home.  Manufactured housing does not necessarily mean motor home.  You do not have the DEED for your property.  You physically transfer the deed whan selling a home, the title stays with the house.  If you are going thru professional channels to sell this house i.e. a realtor, broker, or lender, they can refer you to a title company/attorney who will do that for you and you do not have to waste a lot of time trying to track the deed down.\n\nGOOD LUCK!",this text is about health,1,yahootopics,Health,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

"Question: Can anyone tell me what my glasses prescription means? I went to the optician today and I need to get some glasses. I have some basic knowledge about ophthalmology as I'm about to be a doctor, so I know the basics about how light focuses on the eye etc etc. And I understand the basic concept of astigmatism and how the eye is shaped more lke a rugby ball than a football....\n\nAnyway, my prescription from the optician is:\n\nR: SPH -1.00  CYL -0.50   Axis 115\nL:  SPH -1.25  CYL - 0.50  Axis  90\n\nI understand that it shows myopia in both eyes, left slightly worse than right, but what do the other numbers mean? It's something to do with the degree of astigmatism, but what do they actually show? And what does that mean in terms of my eyes?\n\nJust interested!!!

Answer: SPH = SPHERE\n The amount of long or short sightedness. It always has a plus (+) or a minus (-) sign in front or above it. If the vision in one eye is very poor, the word 'balance' or 'bal' may be written.  For example, i'm -3.00 in both right and left. So baisically, it tells you how blind you are\n\nCYL = CYLINDER (Astigmatism) This is the measure for astigmatism. Again, there is always a plus (+) or minus (-) sign present\n\nAXIS - This will only appear if there is a value for cylinder, as it relates to the cylindrical lens. It will be a number between 1 and 180.

Answer: Probably, pump it through an automotive oil filter.  They are designed to filter out particles a micron or greater and handle all sorts of viscosities of motor oil.  My guess is that the viscosity of cooking oil will be much lower than that of motor oil, so an automotive oil filter should work fine.

"Question: Here's a math question, no answer as far as I can tell...? 3 guys walk into a motel for the night. The clerk says it's $30 for the night, so they pool their money and come up with the cash. Later, the clerk finds he overcharged them by $5. He give a bellboy the $5 in dollar coins, and tells him to give them the money. Rather than giving them the whole thing, the bellboy pockets $2, and gives each of the men $1. Now figure this: instead of paying $10 per person, each man only pays $9 because of the returned dollar. 9 times 3 is 27, and the bellboy pocketed $2. 27 plus 2 is 29. Where's the other dollar?

Answer: The problem misleadingly suggests that the amount the three men paid ($27) and the amount the bellboy kept ($2) SHOULD add up to the original amount ($30).  Not so.  Actually, the $27 INCLUDES the $2.  In other words, of the $30 the three men originally had, $25 went to the motel and $2 went to the bellboy -- that's the $27; the remaining $3 went back to the men.\n\nImagine the same problem with different numbers.  Let's say the clerk discovers he overcharged the men by $27.  He gives the $27 to the bellboy; the bellboy gives each man $1, and keeps $24.  Obviously, the amount the men paid ($27) and the amount the bellboy kept ($24) don't add up to anything significant (and certainly not even close to $30).",this text is about computers & internet,1,yahootopics,Computers & Internet,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

"Question: Heart attack; what are my chances of dieing of a heart attack when i grow up? im 16, my father past away feb. 23rd 2006 of a amssive heart attack and my grandma died of a massive heart attack, both on my dad's side...is there any chance i will also have a bad heart when i grow up? i already have medical problems...i have a sleep apnea, a spinal cord problem and many alergies to different things, but most of those don't matter, im just very afraid of having a bad heart....could someone help me possibly?

Answer: Dear Bobo:\n\nI think it is very natural to feel worried about a heart attack if one's father has just died of one a couple of months ago. \n\nHere is my answer:\n\nFIRST: You ARE worried; the question is, SHOULD you be worried? \n\nThe answer is more difficult than just statistics. If you want statistics, cardiac risk, i.e. the risk of a heart attack can be easily calculated:\n\nhttp://hp2010.nhlbihin.net/atpiii/calculator.asp\n\nBut as it states, this calculator, which is used nearly universally by physicians, applies only for those age 20 or greater. Why is that? Because the heart is like pump -- like any mechanical thing, be it one's car or one's sneakers, it wears out over time, and the older one is, the more likely one is have one's heart give out. Since 20 year olds rarely die of heart attacks (i.e. unless you do crack, etc), its not possible to calculate the odds for the ""average"" 16 year old.\n\nSECOND: What IS a heart attack? Generally, it implies a blockage of one of the arteries supplying blood to the heart. The heart, like any muscle, or any machine, requires fuel -- in this case, oxygen, which is supplied to it by the piping called coronary arteries. When these get plugged up, like any pipe, what is needed can't get through. When this happens to living tissue, the tissue dies. In the case of the heart, as it is the main (and only) pump supplying blood to the rest of the body, if the damage is servere enough, then the pump (i.e. heart) completely fails, the entire body is starved of oxygen, and one passes away.\n\nWhat, then, makes one more likely to have a heart attack? Many things, such as genetics, i.e. a family history of heart disease. But, from this discription, anything that stresses or clogs the piping (arteries) to the heart -- i.e. causes heart disease, also known as atherosclerosis. Stuff like high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes (sugar in the piping, like sugar-water on the table, is sticky and gums up the works), high cholesterol, obesity (which is often a cause of SLEEP APNEA), all increase one's risk.\n\nGenerally, when a healthy 16 year old walks into a doctor's office asking, am i at risk for a heart attack, the physician will likely wonder why the patient is asking, rather than being worried about the patient actually being at risk.\n\nWhich brings me to YOUR question: ""could somebody help me?"" \n\n-- the answer I think is: please, please consider talking to a counselor at your school; friends, siblings, a hotline, a doctor. You are worried about your mortality; And right after a family member has died, more so. It's natural, but often, it helps to talk about it. \n\nGo ask your doctor this question, and see what she or he has to say. It'll be worth it. As for heart disease, see your doctor regularly over the years, listen to their advice, and . . .\n\nKeep well, keep healthy.\n\n-------\n\nDisclaimers: \n\nIn addition to the disclaimers already stated by Yahoo.com: \n\nNOTE: The information communicated here does not constitute or imply a patient-doctor interaction or relationship; the reader and/or recipient of any ""answer"" agrees to hold the writer harmless from any loss, harm, injury or damage resulting from or arising out of your submission of the question or your use of or reliance on any response thereto.\n\nAs Stated: Yahoo!

"Question: you and only you have information about a pending disaster, how would you convince others it was gonna happen? like a tornado or hurricane or a tidal wave, how would you convince others it wasn't a hoax

Answer: You can start a web site like this guy:\nhttp://www.savelivesinmay.com/\n\nHe tried to warn people of a big tsunami on the Atlantic coast on May 26, 2006, based on information from crop circles and messages from extraterrestrials and time travelers.\n\nWhen nothing happened, he updated the page with a press release on June 6, 2006 saying ""Tens of millions of lives saved on May 25, 2006 thanks to the announcement of a giant tsunami for that date!""

"Question: Who would you draft if you were a GM?  And all players were available.? Name your guy at every position factoring in age.  Price is not a consideration.  All players currently playing are eligible.  Just interested to see the picks.

Answer: C:  Joe Mauer - Victor Martinez is a beast offensively, but he's terrible defensively.  Mauer has the best batting average in MLB right now.\n1B:  Pujols - he's easily the #1 overall pick.\n2B:  Rickie Weeks - he's 25, and he has amazing talent; he'll be in many all-star games by the time his career is done.  Soriano is a terrible defensive 2B; Utley would be next on this list if you're talking about a one-year thing.\n3B:  Wright - he barely gets the nod over A-Rod b/c he's younger.  These guys would probably be the #2 and #3 overall picks.\nSS:  Tejada - with Michael Young right behind him (Young has the 2nd most hits behind Ichiro over the last 4 years)\nLF:  Miguel Cabrera - he's batting .350 this year, and he's still in his mid-20s.\nCF:  Vernon Wells - he's only 27 and he's an MVP candidate this year.  Jason Bay is right behind him, with Beltran in the mix as well.\nRF:  I'll go with Vlad - he's a little older at 30, but he's great both offensively and defensively and it's a fairly weak position.\n\nSP:  Santana - he's far and away the best pitcher on the board, and he's just 27.\nSP:  Roy Halladay - only 29 years old, and he'll be a Cy Young contender this year.\nSP:  Brandon Webb - he came up at the same time as D-Train, and right now he's becoming an ace pitcher.\nSP:  Carlos Zambrano - Zambrano's been in the bigs for a while, but he's only 25.  He has nasty stuff as well.\nSP:  Jered Weaver - the 23-year-old showed some nasty stuff in his first few starts in the big leagues.  He'll be a Cy Young contender for years to come.\n\nRP:  Tough call due to the instability of the position.  I suppose you have to go with Paplebon, but the Sox want to make him into a starter eventually.  After Paplebon, I'll go with Bobby Jenks.

"Question: I don't want to be with a smoker!? My husband quit smoking 5 years ago when we were dating. In March he started again. He's promised me a thousand times he going to quit but I see no effort on his part. I worry about his health, I hate the way he smells when he comes in. We have 2 young kids who need a father, and after losing 2 grandparents to lung cancer I'm scared. He blames me for his smoking which is bullsh*t. I stress him out, I didn't cook him breakfast so he couldn't wear his patch, his smoking is none of my business. I didn't marry a smoker, so why should I be stuck with him now? I feel he loves his cigarettes more than me and the kids. Is this wrong of me?

Answer: It is his choice to buy cigarettes, light up and smoke them. No one is holding a gun to his head and forcing him to do this. He keeps that smoking up and it will be the death of him yet. He is not immune to lung cancer or emphysema, these diseases are not prejudice.  He has his top priorites all wrong and he needs to decide what's more important...his smoking or his own health and his family.",this text is about sports,1,yahootopics,Sports,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20
"Question: What is the law regarding a parent's presence at their child's GP consultation? At what age are parents/carer no longer required to attend their child's GP consultation (if they have to at all). Also can a child at anypoint refuse to have a parent present?

Answer: You have parental responsibility until they reach the age of 18, but a child can give their own consent to treatment at the age of 16. Now if the child under 16 makes its own appointment because they did not want the parent involved I am sure that they would be seen but the GP should have a chaperone present...(a nurse) for their own protection and that of the child.\n\n\nAnything discussed between the child and GP alone is confidential, however I am sure that the GP would advise the child of the need for the parents involvement..but this will occur only upon the invitation of the child.\n\nOf course if however the GP feels that the child is at risk he would be obliged to contact Social Services.\n\nI am intrigued by this question...",this text is about education and reference,1,yahootopics,Education & Reference,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

"Question: Any Marine Wives out there? Husband deployed?!? Hi, this is my husbands second deployment and I really miss him! We just had a baby girl who he hasn't seen since she was 3 weeks old she is now 4 months old, and he will hopefully be home in August. Anyway, my question is (if your hubby is deployed or ever has been) how did you keep yourself from going crazy!?!?! lol just wondering how others cope w/ this... I'm getting very anxious for him to come home! Staying busy with my baby, praying, talking to other wives... these help me pass the time. It is nice to hear from others that are going or that have been through the same thing. What do ya think ladies?

Answer: I'm actually army, but I've been through one deployment and we're waiting for the official verdict on the second.  You sound like you're doing the right thing, talking to people who are going through the same thing, etc.  It is hard and I don't want to sound cold, but you get used to it.  I know it's harder for those who are relatively new in the military, and hard for new parents, but you get in a groove and things go easier.  Stay strong, he needs it as much as your baby does.  Stay positive, don't watch the news too often if ever (I never did, it's a lot of worry and not the whole story), and keep that support structure around you.  And know what community resources are there for you in the military.  They're already paid for by your tax dollars, so use them, it's like getting a tax refund every time you do. \n\nIt's almost over, keep your head up, girl.",this text is about science & mathematics,1,yahootopics,Science & Mathematics,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

"Question: What could cause recurring blisters in the exact same area? For about 6 years now, I get these blisters on left elbow in the exact same spot. They itch when they are forming and as they go away, but hurt to touch pretty much from begining to end. It is usually just one main blister, but sometimes there are several smaller ones surrounding it. They are red and raised but never fill with puss and burst. They just seem to dry up and go away. It is bothersome and of course looks odd. A few years back, it was suggested that it might be shingles, but there is none of that intense nerve pain I hear about and my parents can't agree on if I ever had chickenpox or not. As it heals it does flake some. A doctor that saw it at that stage told me it was fungal before running out of the room and on to the next patient. I just can't find anything that matches up.

Answer: This sounds to me like a classic herpes virus infection.  These are very common.  Shingles is a form of herpes called herpes zoster but I think you have Herpes simplex.  The only way to know for sure is to get checked when you have a fresh outbreak.  A doctor can do a Tzanck preparation which is essentially a free test, they just take a sample and look under the microscope after the slide is stained.  If you want to get high tech, you can ask for a viral pcr test of a fresh lesion.  These are extremely accurate but a bit more expensive.  You may be able to go to a free STD clinic for their expertise.  Although this is not an STD problem, those doctors are pretty skilled with skin conditons.

Answer: Rough sex is wild, energetic sexual intercourse. Bites, scratches, bleeding, and bruising are not an uncommon result. More often sex of this nature involves humiliation, spitting, choking, urinating, slapping or rough analingus.\n\nAlthough rough sex may appear violent, rough sex is not rape or sexual assault.

"Question: Why is there not more controversy over archaeological digs that tamper with sacred burials? 

Answer: Sometimes the archaeologist is preserving the contents of the sacred burials by first identifying them as such, and then removing them. Many construction companies and builders will call for the services of an archaeologist if they come across artifacts in the course of their digging. The US Armed Forces routinely sends in archaeological survey teams to areas that they own, prior to using those areas for training or testing explosives and artillery. In very rare cases, if sacred burials are found will the site be preserved intact. Oftentimes, all that can be done is to save as much as the site as possible and transplanting them intact elsewhere.\n\nMeanwhile, there is considerable attention paid to returning disputed artifacts and objects from sacred burials to the people who demonstrate kinship, as seen in the publicised prosecution of the curators and dealers associated with the Getty.",this text is about computers & internet,1,yahootopics,Computers & Internet,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

"Question: What about your dad? How many men out there know wether or not the father's are circumcised?  How many are opposite status of they're fathers?  And I might be weird, but does anyone else look and men based on culture and age and wonder wether or not the are circucised?

Answer: I am circumcised. My father isn't. He took medical advice prevalent at the time that circumcision was beneficial but which has since been proved incorrect. If I could have my foreskin back, I would take it any day.\n\nThese days there are NO hygenic reasons for circumcision if you bathe at least once a day. There will therefore be no smell. Accusations otherwise are just born out of ignorance. If you consider most of European men, for instance, are uncircumcised, don't you think they would have moved to circumcision en masse long ago if circumcision was the most hygenic and correct thing to do?\n\nAlmost all other reasons for circumcision are now medically treatable and therefore, circumcision is unneccessary.\n\nFor women, an intact penis is DESIGNED to work better that a circumcised one because the foreskin allows for greater movement during sexual intercourse and less lubrication is required.\n\nIt is also better for the man because his glans is soft and sensitive - the glans on circumcised penises gets thick and hard over the years and decreases sensitivity and can even lead to erection problems.",this text is about business & finance,1,yahootopics,Business & Finance,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

Answer: To play most modern game you will have to change 2 (maybe 3) things on your PC.\n\n1. Your graphics card, I believe the 6100 is onboard.  There are problems with this graphics card (the 6100 and the 6200) when playing certain games, even though it's in the 6 range this is the lowest of that range.  If you stick with nVidia change it to the 6600 or the 7600.  You will notice the improved performance straight away when playing games like Oblivion.\n\n2. Increase your RAM, 256-512mb is the norm now a days for games, but remember you will also have background proceses running in Windows while you play games.  Increase this to a minimum of 1 gb, pref 2gb.  Again you will see a good inprovement when you play games.\n\n3. This is optional, a bigger hard drive.  Depending on how much space you have left on your PC, you may wish to have more.  Remember you need at lest 12% free disk space to perform a good defrag and with new games taking more and more space, you'll soon run out of HD space.  Maybe upgrade to a 200gb drive or bigger.\n\nThe rest of your spec's are great.  Remember AMD mark up their CPU's differently than Intel, so because you have a 3300+, it's preformance speed is suppose to run at a 3ghz chip while it's core speed run's at 2ghz. *However in the next few yesrs you may wish to take a look at the dual core chips from AMD & Intel, but it's not necessary at the moment.\n\nHope this helps",this text is about society & culture,1,yahootopics,Society & Culture,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

Answer: New Orleans will never be the same.  Much of the culture and history of it have been washed away forever with the people that were lost, rather to death or moving away.  I heard a statistic recently that stated the percentages of African Americans there went from like 75-90% down to like less than 10%.  That is so sad.  It will be re-built, urbanized, modernized, commercialized...and de-culturalized.  Bottom line.

"Question: How can I be a supplier to stores if I can offer merchandise, mainly garments from overseas, at a cheap price? I have contacts with many garments factory owners who are ready to supply big orders at very competetive prices. Can someone tell me how I go about on this to find a buyer in the USA? i live in minneapolis. I will be the middle man in all these and for that do I need to register a business name or what do I have to do? Thanks for the help.

Answer: You're going to want to handle a few things here.  You've got to establish yourself legally as a distributor, which probably involves incorporating or at least setting up an LLC.  (You don't want the personal risk of a shipment going south, do you?)  \n\nSecond, you're going to want to establish distribution fulfillment (how long does it take to get things here, what choices do clients have, what terms are you willing to provide, what kind of shipping insurance, etc. are you putting together to make this a predictable process?)\n\nNext, you're going to want to establish a business presence.  The large retail organization will have buyers: professionals that choose what's going to be in a certain season or promotion's lineup.  You've got to get them the goods, interface with them, and meet their expectations.\n\nI'd recommend one general book for your process: The New Conceptual Selling.  You're going to want to manage client expectations and go through a fact-finding process with them that's going to match their win with your ability to fulfill it.  \n\nI'd also recommend that you meet one or two buyers before investing too much into the business.  You can explain your position and get an actual buyer to teach you at least a few pointers.  Once you get those pointers down, you will be well-enough grounded to actually start the conceptual sales cycle with potential clients.\n\nWhen you're finally to this point, you're going to buy a list of buyers (infousa.com is a reputable source) and prospect them in a regular, cyclical way.  Prospecting Your Way to Sales Success by Bill Good is a great approach to this.  (Kind of a cheesy book, but still the best one I've found out there.)  \n\nThis is probably a very good business for you to get into if you have reliable sources and know what they can safely deliver for you.  Be sure you are delivering what you're selling, and you'll build a business for yourself.\n\nOne alternative approach you can take is to do the same thing with designers (usually out of New York).  These guys are going to drive the biggest retail companies' buy decisions.  For these, you'd position yourself as a direct-factory resource for whatever they're designing.  They'll have exacting standards of quality, materials, textile treatments, delivery times, sizes, etc.  They'd probably be a much more steady source of revenue for you, once you establish yourself with them.\n\nGood luck!",this text is about education and reference,1,yahootopics,Education & Reference,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

"Question: What is with this ""all"" Christians thing? I am a Christian, but have lightened up over time. I dont attend church, I think its full of hypocrites. I think homosexuality is a sin, but dont care who does it, have gay friends, and support gay marriage. I think everyone is entitled to make up their own minds, religious or not.\n\nSo what gives? I am so sick of being lumped in with fire and brimstone, hypocritical, bible thumping, shove it down your throat Chrisitians. ""All Christians are rude"", ""All Christians are liars"". Its like saying ALL homosexuals are pedophiles, even though only a small percentage is, or ALL killing is murder, when legally not all of it is (abortions). What is with these broad generalizations? Dont non-believers know how to spell SOME, and stop lumping us all into the far right movement?

Answer: A lot of nonbelievers accuse Christians of making broad generalizations and having closed minds, but the more I read what they write, the more I see it the other way around. Christians are basically in agreement on ""Salvation through Christ"" but then I see they branch out in other directions. I think this should be proof to nonchristians that not ALL Christians think the same and most think for themselves.",this text is about family & relationships,1,yahootopics,Family & Relationships,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

"Question: Is recycling really necessary, or just B.S? Does bundling paper and crushing milk cartons really make a difference or is that just a way of making people think they are helping?

Answer: Recycling saves energy, landfill space and the planet.  It is necessary on many levels.  Some examples are:  Aluminum cans made from recycled metal only use 5% of the energy that's needed to make that same can from non-recycled metal.  Every ton of paper you recycle is 17 trees that didn't have to be cut down.  So if you look at the amount of stuff we recycle you can see that it really does make a difference.  Also, most of the materials we are currently collecting go back into making the things we buy.  If we didn't use recycled content, we would have less resources to use in manufacturing.",this text is about education and reference,1,yahootopics,Education & Reference,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

"Question: Is there a cure for shyness?? I am really shy, and I have been ever since I moved to Idaho.  Before I lived in Idaho, I was incredibly outgoing.  I mean I have friends now, but I would like to be able to ask a question in class with out feeling like an idiot.  I think that on the inside I am incredibly outgoing, but my second 3rd grade teacher changed me I think... Can you help me??

Answer: Oh my... well there is hope for you to not be shy. People laugh at me when I tell them I used to be shy. I would literally start puking in school if I thought I would have to do or talk in front of someone. One day I was on a school bus and some kids were picking on a boy that was a bit slow... (older and popular boys) and I decided I had to stand up for this boy. I did and I let them have it and to my knowledge they never picked on that boy again but what happened is after I did that I was like WOW that wasn't so hard or bad and I slowly started gaining confidence. I have actually done public speaking now. Chaired committees and even served as a Jury foreman. I just decided life was to short to be afraid any longer and I made a decision to just go for all I could. I want you to know in certain circumstances I still sometimes feel the tendency to be shy but I just keep going and then I have a great time. I have great faith that you can do this also. Just take one day at a time.\nSo sorry that your 3rd grade teacher was so arghhhhhh!!! Don't give up on others or yourself because of her. Dust yourself off and go for all you want!!!

Answer: Of course it's true. She's not fighting so hard to say it's not true because she's trying to protect her reputation! She's sold sex since she asked the world to hit her one more time. If there wasn't a tape, she'd let the story play out since it gives her publicity...and not any publicity she isn't already familiar with, right?!! Because there's a tape, she's fighting like crazy... That would be the absolute end for her and she knows it.

"Question: who realy created madi gras? 

Answer: Early Christians. The roots of Mardi Gras, Easter, and Christmas celebrations can be traced back to ancient Roman celebrations. As the Christian religion was forming, it was easier to bring converts from other religions if the major celebrations were kept intact, but given new Christian meanings. It is clear from the Bible that the Nativity didn't happen in winter (lambs aren't born then nor do shepherds tend them in the fields). The Roman feast of Saturnalia which included decorating with evergreen boughs and giving presents in an effort to entice the sun to return for another year was transformed into a celebration of the birth of Christ. The Roman feast of Oestre in the springtime, a celebration of fertility that included rabbits and eggs, was transformed by the Christians into Easter. \n\nLent is a 40 day period of abstinence prior to Easter. As one last blow-out, a celebration was held prior to the beginning of Lent. As the Lenten festival devloped over the centuries, it spread from 12th Night (supposedly the night the Wise Men arrived at Nazareth, actually the 12th night after Christmas) and lasted until Fat Tuesday, the day before the 40 days of Lent began.\n\n""Mardi Gras"" is French for Fat Tuesday. The festival has had other names in other languages. It cemented in our culture due to a 1699 French explorer who landed at a point in Louisiana on Fat Tuesday and named the place Point du Mardi Gras in honor of the celebration taking place in his native country.",this text is about business & finance,1,yahootopics,Business & Finance,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

"Question: Was the ""mission accomplished""? Bush said it was acconplished few years back.  Was it really accomplished?

Answer: It is puzzling as to why Bush's folks would so brazenly display the banner for all the world to see. Because certainly it's obvious: no weapons of mass destruction have or will be found (unless the U.S. plants them); nor did the Iraqi government use any against the United States. So that mission wasn't accomplished. And it's pretty clear that the Iraqi civilians haven't been liberated, unless you consider being shot at and killed for protesting against the United States, liberation. Or having your collective history and rich culture destroyed in a matter of weeks, liberation. Or going without sufficient food, water or medical care, liberation. Or having an interim government imposed on you, liberation. So that mission, unfortunately, wasn't accomplished either.\nPretty pathetic scorecard. But certainly if Karl Rove decided to parade the banner ""Mission Accomplished,"" they had to have accomplished something.

"Question: What is with this ""all"" Christians thing? I am a Christian, but have lightened up over time. I dont attend church, I think its full of hypocrites. I think homosexuality is a sin, but dont care who does it, have gay friends, and support gay marriage. I think everyone is entitled to make up their own minds, religious or not.\n\nSo what gives? I am so sick of being lumped in with fire and brimstone, hypocritical, bible thumping, shove it down your throat Chrisitians. ""All Christians are rude"", ""All Christians are liars"". Its like saying ALL homosexuals are pedophiles, even though only a small percentage is, or ALL killing is murder, when legally not all of it is (abortions). What is with these broad generalizations? Dont non-believers know how to spell SOME, and stop lumping us all into the far right movement?

Answer: A lot of nonbelievers accuse Christians of making broad generalizations and having closed minds, but the more I read what they write, the more I see it the other way around. Christians are basically in agreement on ""Salvation through Christ"" but then I see they branch out in other directions. I think this should be proof to nonchristians that not ALL Christians think the same and most think for themselves.",this text is about society & culture,0,yahootopics,Society & Culture,0,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

Answer: There are several programs that are free that can do write movies to DVD RW. Just look up my source and search for DVD burner. I must caution using DVD RW disks and their use as movies. DVD RW is intended to store data that is changing. They make great backup disks and can be erased if the file change is too great. However, over time, DVD RW does loose their ability to store large amounts of data. This is accelerated when the DVD RW is forced to hold almost a full disc and then erased to hold another full disk (The average movie is about 3.8 GB). If you keep re-using A DVD RW just for movies, then you will literally burn out your disc. DVD R is intended to be used on data that is not changing. Like movies for example. I would have to say use a DVD R for movies and use the DVD RW for any data needs. Again, you can use DVD RW for movies but I would not want to waste a DVD RW on just movies.",this text is about sports,1,yahootopics,Sports,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20
"Question: Science Help!? I need to know what do those words mean in ur OWN words:\nBedrock, Loose rock,Gravel, and drumline.\nAnd how does ice age forms?\nAnd do you know any good documentary about ice age(not the movie)\nthxx

Answer: Bedrock is the native consolidated rock underlying the Earth's surface. Above the bedrock is usually an area of broken and weathered unconsolidated rock in the basal subsoil. The term implies that the rock lies in beds, or strata. Under any given location on the surface of the planet, rock will be found. The term bedrock may be somewhat misleading, since in many locations, the bedrock may change over a short distance, or the technical bedrock may be a thin stratum overlying quite different rock.\nGravel is rock that is of a certain grain size range. In geology, gravel is any loose rock that is at least two millimeters in its largest dimension (about 1/12 of an inch), and no more than 75 millimeters (about 3 inches).\nLoose rock is larger rock piled up loosely and it can move when disturbed by any type of vibration. The type of rock in land slides.\nI have never heard of a drumline\nAn ice age is a period of long-term downturn in the temperature of Earth's climate, resulting in an expansion of the continental ice sheets, polar ice sheets and mountain glaciers (""glaciation""). Glaciologically, ice age is often used to mean a period of ice sheets in the northern and southern hemispheres; by this definition we are still in an ice age (because the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets still exist). More colloquially, when speaking of the last few million years, ice age is used to refer to colder periods with extensive ice sheets over the North American and Eurasian continents: in this sense, the last ice age ended about 10,000 years ago. This article will use the term ice age in the former, glaciological, sense; and use the term glacial periods for colder periods during ice ages and interglacial for the warmer periods.\nMany glacial periods have occurred during the last few million years, initially at 40,000-year frequency but more recently at 100,000-year frequencies. These are the best studied. There have been four major ice ages in the further past.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_age\n\ngo to the link below for a documentary\nhttp://a614.g.akamai.net/7/614/2201/v001/aetn.download.akamai.com/2201/thc/classroom/guides/ice_age_study_guide.pdf",this text is about society & culture,1,yahootopics,Society & Culture,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20
"Question: What is YTM (yield to Maturity ) of a bond ? What is the formula to find it  ? I want to calculate the YTM of a bond. How to find it ?

Answer: The rate of return anticipated on a bond if it is held until the maturity date. YTM is considered a long-term bond yield expressed as an annual rate. The calculation of YTM takes into account the current market price, par value, coupon interest rate and time to maturity. It is also assumed that all coupons are reinvested at the same rate. Sometimes this is simply referred to as ""yield"" for short.\n\nTo calculate it, you can use the YIELD function in Excel. (Go to Tools>Add ins and select Analysis Toolpak if the function is not listed). This function essentially determines what rate is needed to discount the future cash flows of the bond to make the present value equal to the current price.",this text is about business & finance,0,yahootopics,Business & Finance,0,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

"Question: Ask The Grandkids About Grandma and Grandpa's Retirement? We always spend our vacation with Grandma and Grandpa. They used to live here in a big, brick house, but Grandpa got retarded and they moved to Florida and now they live in a place with a lot of other retarded people. \n\nThey live in a tin box and have rocks painted green to look like grass. They ride around on big tricycles and wear name tags because they don't know who they are anymore. \n\nThey go to a building called a wrecked center, but they must have got it fixed because it is all right now. They play games and do exercises there, but they don't do them very well. \n\nThere is a swimming pool too, but they all jump up and down in it with their hats on. I guess they don't know how to swim. \n\nAt their gate there is a dollhouse with a little old man sitting in it. He watches all day so nobody can escape.  Sometimes they sneak out. Then they go cruising in their golf carts. \n\nMy grandma used to bake cookies and stuff, but I guess she forgot how. Nobody there cooks, they just eat out. And they eat the same thing every night: Early Birds. \n\nSome of the people can't get past the man in the dollhouse to go out, so the ones who get out bring food back to the wrecked center and call it pot luck. \n\nMy Grandma says Grandpa worked all his life to earn his retardment and says I should work hard so I can be retarded one day, too. \n\nWhen I earn my retardment I want to be the man in the dollhouse. Then I will let people out so they can visit their grandchildren.

"Question: what's the truth on fluorescent bulb efficiency? re: turning on & off? OK, i've seen & heard this both ways up from otherwise credible sources recently. But either one is right & other wrong, or vice versa, or they're both wrong. They can't both be right.\n\nStandpoint 1: A fluorescent bulb is very efficient, but turning it on is not, and you have to leave it t1urned on for at least 15 minutes if not much longer to burn up the same power required to jolt it into life and produce an arc. Therefore turning it on and off repeatedly not only burns up your starter capacitor, but also wastes a lot of electricity.\n\nStandpoint 2: Turning on a fluorescent bulb uses very little electricity vs leaving it turned on long-term, with the equivalent of 15 seconds being quite excessive.\n\nI'm not sure which camp to go with. Not the first, because - where does all that pile of energy go to? That's about 15kWh all in one go for a 60w bulb. It would destroy both the starter and the bulb. But the second seems a little low - you still need a ""flashbulb"" effect to get the arc...!?

Answer: A fluorescent tube has filaments at each end that have to heat up to vaporize the mercury necessary to start the tube.  Since they start so fast, the starting doesn't really cost that much more in electricity usage.\n\nHowever, the ballast on the twin 40 watt tube fixture uses about 20 watts by itself.  Thus, two 40 watt bulbs require 100 watts to operate.\n\nOnce the tube has started, the filaments are no longer activated and no longer consume power.  Since they burn hot, turning the bulb on and off will shorted the life of the tube.",this text is about politics & government,1,yahootopics,Politics & Government,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

I have some basic knowledge about ophthalmology as I'm about to be a doctor, so I know the basics about how light focuses on the eye etc etc. And I understand the basic concept of astigmatism and how the eye is shaped more lke a rugby ball than a football....\n\nAnyway, my prescription from the optician is:\n\nR: SPH -1.00  CYL -0.50   Axis 115\nL:  SPH -1.25  CYL - 0.50  Axis  90\n\nI understand that it shows myopia in both eyes, left slightly worse than right, but what do the other numbers mean? It's something to do with the degree of astigmatism, but what do they actually show? And what does that mean in terms of my eyes?\n\nJust interested!!!

Answer: SPH = SPHERE\n The amount of long or short sightedness. It always has a plus (+) or a minus (-) sign in front or above it. If the vision in one eye is very poor, the word 'balance' or 'bal' may be written.  For example, i'm -3.00 in both right and left. So baisically, it tells you how blind you are\n\nCYL = CYLINDER (Astigmatism) This is the measure for astigmatism. Again, there is always a plus (+) or minus (-) sign present\n\nAXIS - This will only appear if there is a value for cylinder, as it relates to the cylindrical lens. It will be a number between 1 and 180. It may or may not be written with a degree 'o' symbol after the number. \n\n\nHope this helps",this text is about science & mathematics,0,yahootopics,Science & Mathematics,0,gpt-4o-2024-11-20
"Question: How can I tell her that I don't want to be close friends anymore? I admit, this sounds kind of mean, but I have to ask. It's driving me crazy.

"Question: ???? stay or go home? When I married my husband I was 7 mo. pregnant. when I had the baby I let my brother move in with us for a while. Things quickly crashed for us. I couldnt stand it anymore between the both of them ganging up on me and being assholes. While i took care of my new son. They expected that I stay home to clean spotless and keep my mouth shut. I left in feb of this year with my son and moved to another town. My brother moved out and my ex is alone. I cant help but feel that because we had no time as newleyweds that that is the reason our marrage failed. I love him but was so hurt. Should we try to work things out?

Answer: Think about how far you have come, all the good things in life now, how you can walk into a peaceful home and not feel that tension.\nHow hard was it to leave?\nTo start over?\nTo rebuild your life.....\nis it worth risking that all over again if your marriage doesn't work?  If the answer is yes, then go back.\nNo one here knows if it will work however, a man that belittles his wife rarely rarely changes. He should have defended you when your brother picked on you.

"Question: How much does medical school cost and how hard is it to get in? 

Answer: I am starting my 4th year of Medical School at UT San Antonio in Texas.  I am lucky because Texas offers its residents the least expensive medical school in the US with tuition and fees of about 11K to 12 K per year.  Books, living expenses, etc...all add up of course, but the federal student loan program allows anyone who is willing to live frugally (my budget for living expenses on loans only is about 1500 per month and this is not difficult to do) the ability to borrow all that is necessary to pay for school and live.  You will be borrowing probably 150K over the 4 years, but you can consolidate and pay it back over long enough that it is do-able if you really want to do it.  \n\nAnother option is the military program.  Any branch of the military offers a stipend that will basically give you the same amount of money that loans do per month, pay for tuition, fees and books and in exchange you will pay back year for year to the military.  So, you will not be in any debt at all when you complete your time committment to the military.  They are recruiting strongly now and allow many things, such as older than usual or past medical histories of some things, that they would not have allowed in the past.  This is a good option if you are not comfortable with debt.\n\nAs for how difficult it is to get in my advice is this.  When I decided to apply some people laughed at me and said I would never make it because I was a fine arts major and went to a smaller, less than impressive undergraduate school, but I DID get in and if you really want to - you will too.  Check the school web sites for necessary prerequisites and time lines to apply, do some volunteer work or work as an orderly or something like that in a hospital - this will prove that you are motivated, and then take the MCAT entrance exam (I HIGHLY recommend a preparation course prior to taking this exam - they are MORE than worth the money).  Apply - if you don't get in the first try - go in person to talk with someone in the admissions department at a medical school and talk with them openly about your application.  Take their advice and re-apply.  We need good doctors.  So, if you feel the calling, don't let anything get in your way!",this text is about politics & government,1,yahootopics,Politics & Government,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

Answer: Probably, pump it through an automotive oil filter.  They are designed to filter out particles a micron or greater and handle all sorts of viscosities of motor oil.  My guess is that the viscosity of cooking oil will be much lower than that of motor oil, so an automotive oil filter should work fine.

"Question: Why was 1 John 5:7 changed in the KJV of the Bible? 1 John 5:7--""For there are three that testify."" A few very late manuscripts add in heaven—the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit, and these three are one.""\nBible manuscripts that were written prior to the Eleventh Century C.E (A.D.) read quite differently. So, it appears as though this verse was changed about 1,000 years after John penned it by someone who wanted to provide scriptural backing to the Trinity doctrine.\nWhen reading John the Fifth Chapter, the three witness-bearers are the water (baptism), the Breath (Gr. pneuma – the Breath of God), and the (shed) blood (of Jesus). Changing the water, the Breath, and the blood to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost would make the rest of what John wrote illogical; so that rendering is totaly false.

Answer: Trinitarians love to regurgitate philosophy, Greek, , and quotes from other Babylon-loving Trinitarians. When Trinitarians dishonestly quote the spurious version of 1 John 5:7, they are merely quoting the human work of a trinitarian, rather than the godly work of the apostle John or of the divine Author.\n\nBy contrast, Jehovah's Witnesses believe that the Scriptures alone quite plainly demonstrate that Jesus and the Almighty are separate distinct persons, and the Almighty created Jesus as His firstborn son.\n\n(Colossians 1:15) the firstborn of all creation\n\n(Mark 10:18) Jesus said to him: 'Why do you call me good? Nobody is good, except one, God.\n\n(Revelation 3:14) the Amen says, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation by God\n\n(Philippians 2:5-6) Christ Jesus, who, although he was existing in God's form, gave no consideration to a seizure, namely, that he should be equal to God\n\n(John 8:42) Neither have I come of my own initiative at all, but that One sent me forth\n\n(John 12:49) I have not spoken out of my own impulse, but the Father himself who sent me has given me a commandment as to what to tell and what to speak\n\n(John 14:28) I am going my way to the Father, because the Father is greater than I am\n\n(1 Corinthians 15:28) But when all things will have been subjected to him, then the Son himself will also subject himself to the One who subjected all things to him\n\n(Matthew 20:23) this sitting down at my right hand and at my left is not mine to give, but it belongs to those for whom it has been prepared by my Father\n\n(1 Corinthians 11:3) I want you to know that the head of every man is the Christ; ...in turn the head of the Christ is God\n\n(John 20:17) I am ascending to my Father and your Father and to my God and your God.\n\n(Deuteronomy 6:4) Jehovah our God is one Jehovah\n\n(1 Corinthians 8:4-6) There is no God but one.

Answer: The  Locust can increase extremely rapidly in numbers with the possibility of four generations through spring, summer, and autumn.

They are formidable eating machines that can rapidly devastate crops.

Answer: High doses of Vitamin B6 (300 milligrams or more per day) for long periods of time (greater than 6 months) in a few people has caused peripheral neuropathy.\n\n100 mg/day is considered safe.  I do not know why your doctor is recommending B6 for the treatment of your chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy.  I just did a 'quick' search of Pubmed (where the world's medical research can be reviewed) and found several studies showing the supplement Acetyl-L-Carnitine may be effective for the treatment of chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathies.

Answer: The difference is that the catechism of the catholic church teaches love and respect for all people. You have to remember that extremists make all people look bad. Think of Islam. Anyway, you have to take things in context. Look at the fundamental teachings of christ. Read the New Testament, it will be good for you. All religions follow those fundamental teachings, and the only reason for the crusades, and all of those other things you mentioned, was that some extremist's power went to his head and he decided to start making rules. Also bear in mind that if Hitler had died in 1938, he would have been hailed as a hero.

"Question: who do you think will be more of an impact player from the draft? pick on......reggie bush, a.j hawk, matt leinhart, or mario williams, why?

Answer: As far as their rookie seasons are concerned, I'd say A.J. Hawk.  Bush will share carries with Deuce Mcallister.  Leinart will probably stay on the bench for at least the first 8 games.  If he starts, he'll suck like most rookie QBs.  Williams will - like most DEs in the 3-4 scheme - probably get stuck taking on tackles so the Texans linebackers can make plays.  I don't expect eye-popping stats from him.  Hawk, however, is practically a guaranteed starter at a position that traditionally racks up the tackles.",this text is about society & culture,1,yahootopics,Society & Culture,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

"Question: What major mistakes did the American military make in the Vietnam war? 

Answer: The United States was never willing to do what was necessary to end North Vietnamese and world communism help to the Viet Cong insurrection, if we can use World War II as an example. President Johnson was always presented with options that could have truly devastated North Vietnam, but it would have amounted to the amount of civilian casualties that he simply was not willing to take responsibility for. He could have flooded much of North Vietnam like the USAF flooded the Rhine valley. He was never willing to strike the most important targets because they were very likely to have Russian advisors present, and he was not willing to start World War III.\n\nNo American administration was willing to really confront the problem of the corruption in the South Vietnamese leadership. While the USAF was obliterating the Ho Chi Minh trail, the ARVN leadership was selling war material to the Viet Cong. The ARVN leadership was fleecing their own people and putting them into relocation camps not to protect them but to take their land.\n\nPresident Nixon was often using action in the Vietnam war as cover for his domestic problems, as stated in an interview with Pat Buchanan. He was willing to make an uneven peace in 1973 to get peoples' minds off of other problems.\n\nThe war was not lost by the soldiers, it was lost by the politicians in Washington and in Saigon.",this text is about computers & internet,1,yahootopics,Computers & Internet,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

It just makes me wonder why we have to try and change others. And why do religious questions disturb so many people? So many get defensive at the slightest question. Why do they answer simple questions with riddles and propoganda? Religion is grey.  It will never be proven or disproven. Is that why we argue so much about it, because we know that no one can ever prove us wrong?

Answer: You would need to be granted emancipation by a court.  \n\nEmancipation laws vary by state and not all states have an emancipation statute, which doesn’t mean that you can’t petition for it, because you can pretty ask the court for whatever you want, but in those states there is no actual ‘procedure’ in place.\n\nYou need to check the laws of your state. At a minimum you would be required to prove that you are capable of fully supporting yourself--paying for rent/utilities/food/medical expenses/etc with no assistance from anyone. You would also have to provide a *valid* reason that emancipation would be in your best interest. The court could require other things as well.\n\nThe court can deny emancipation for any reason that it sees fit, including, but not limited to, their belief that you lack the maturity/ability to function as an adult.\n\nGenerally speaking, it is not a quick or easy process, and more often than not, it is denied.",this text is about entertainment and music,1,yahootopics,Entertainment & Music,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

The only reason we are being targeted by legal people is because they feel threaten by us they now realize thatwe can become better,we are no longer ignorant and we don't let anybody push us around any more just because u have papers doesn't make u a better person. We don't go out shooting people at schools those are white people . We know how to respect others and we teach our children to respect others.

"Question: Who is the next Super Power ? China - World's fastest growing economy, Huge Exports\nIndia - World's second fastest growing economy, huge FDI (Foreign Investment), leader in Information Technology\nRussia - Had the highest profit in trade last year, Biggest Petroleum Reserves.\n\nOr any other nation\nPlease provide a logical reasoning if you choose a different country that's not listed here

Answer: To be a super power, a country needed to be very strong militarily, economically and in global values.\n\nThe People's Republic of China is often considered a rising major power due to its large and stable population, its rapidly growing economy, and its rapidly growing military spending and capabilities.\n\nSimilar to China, India has a population of over one billion, nuclear weapons, the world's 2nd largest land-force and 4th largest airforce, as well as a thriving economy (4th largest in PPP). India also enjoys the advantage of a large and well-educated English-speaking workforce. The biggest obstacle: India is still a ""developing"" country in many respects with poor infrastructure, a huge poor and under-educated lower class that has a tremendous gap with the middle and upper classes; widespread corruption, brain-drain, social and ethnic tensions as well as potential conflict with its neighbor and rival, Pakistan. Despite India's widespread poverty, the Indian middle class consists of approximately 200 million people and poverty levels have been falling consistently since the '90s, though in rural areas, where most Indians still live, there has been little improvement. Today, approximately 20% of India's population lives in absolute poverty. It is thought that India's democratic foundations ensure some kind of long term government stability.\n\nRussia still possesses some attributes of a world power, notably including the world's largest arsenal of nuclear weapons, inherited from the USSR. It also has the proven ability to conduct manned space travel. Perhaps most importantly, it is the geographically largest country of the world and has control over a variety of strategic raw materials. Russia still has a clear capacity for destructive force, which in light of the current delicate political situation is not calculable beyond the medium-term. As one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, Russia also has notable political influence in the world. However, Russia's economy is generally thought to be unstable and less competitive on a global scale. The population has been shrinking since the fall of the Soviet Union and is predicted to fall even lower within the next 10 years, due to drastically shortened life expectancies since 1990 and falling birthrates. Life in what was one of the safest places in the world has become rife with danger and insecure for most people. Furthermore, Russia is unable to control Chechen separatism and terrorism that is threatening neighbouring areas in the south and could lead to the break up of the south of the country. Russia is also unable to prevent illegal Chinese immigration into Asian Russia which may cause the eventual loss of that mineral rich region. A major brain drain of Russia's vast coterie of high quality scientists and engineers, a legacy of its excellent Soviet era education system, is also occurring and undermining Russia's long term economic development. Out of control post Soviet corruption diverts vast sums of government resources away from valuable programs. Corruption is also endemic in its business sector.",this text is about science & mathematics,1,yahootopics,Science & Mathematics,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

Answer: They have already done well, and after not being part of the World Cup for 32 years, just to be here was a good performance. \n\nI believe we favourites to get through to the 2nd round, due to the fact that we do not NEED to win. This tilts the chances slightly in our favour, but do not underestimate Croatia, who have a tough team and are proven at the World Cup (semi finalists in 1998 and have qualified every time they have attempted - 1998, 2002 and 2006)\n\nAustralia will likely face Italy, Ghana or Czech Republic in the 2nd round (assuming they finish 2nd in their group, USA cannot top their group). \n\nIf they play Czech Republic, they will almost definately lose (although Guus is a genius and a hate to write him off).\n\nIf they face Italy, they will be massive underdogs. While Italy don't look impressive, we know that they are famous for under performing.\n\nIf they face Ghana, I believe we are favourites.

"Question: how to India became a powerful country? first of all remove illitracey nd than the orthodox in our country chage there view such as castism nd give a oppurtunity to the talent of our nation

Answer: There are several many ways India can become a powerful country:\n\n1) First of all, get rid of all the muslims!!!  As long as this disease is in India, nothing positive is possible\n2) The government needs to be more effective in tackling all types of corruption.  They should promulgate stiffer legislation for corruption, and people who report cases of corruption should be awarded.\n3) Education must be made mandatory until 18 years old.\n4) the size of the armed forces must be increased two fold and there should be a increase in defence expenditure.\n5) The government should make much easier for ordinary people to access education and business loans\n6) Indians should be encouraged to ""save"" more.\n7) The millions of people living in poverty should be trained to produce certain goods.  Not only shall this enable them to work themselves out of poverty, but it shall be good for the level of Indian exports.\n8) India must undertake a much proactive effort to export goods to states, with whom our trade relations remain under developed and under utilised.  These include South American, Eastern European and African states.\n9) Our strength lies in services.  We should balance it out with production and manufacturing.\n10) In terms of foreign policy, we should augment relations with the USA, Israel, the EU states and Japan.\n11) Bodybuilding and Martial Arts (with a Hindu ethos) must be made compulsory in schools and colleges.  This will allow the Hindu man to change the international stereotype of him being a docile weak figure into that of a tough testosterone god.\n12) Our economy must be excelled in every way possible. Services, Manufacturing, exports, savings,.  At the moment India's natural resources remain ridiculously underdeveloped and under utilised.  This includes oil.  Oh and btw, the central forests (which Maoist rebels are occupying) are a rich source of aluminium.\n\nBefore we Indians can proceed to accomplish the aforementioned.  We must examine the encumbrances and obstacles that we face.  These include\n\n1) India's unwanted Muslim population\n2) Corruption\n3) Over population\n4) inefficiency in government and bureaucracy\n5) apathy on the part of Indians\n6) lack of funds, initiative and professionalism\n7) lack of patriotism and nationalism among Indians",this text is about computers & internet,1,yahootopics,Computers & Internet,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

"Question: What is black  powder? 

Answer: Black powder is a type of gunpowder invented in the 9th century and was practically the only known propellant and explosive until the middle of the 19th century. It has been superseded by more efficient explosives such as smokeless powders and TNT. It is still manufactured today but primarily for use in fireworks, model rocket engines, and reproductions of muzzleloading weapons\nBlack powder consists of the granular ingredients sulphur (S), charcoal (provides carbon to the reaction) and saltpetre (saltpetre, potassium nitrate, KNO3; provides oxygen to the reaction).\n\nA simple, commonly cited, chemical equation for the combustion of black powder is:\n\n2 KNO3 + S + 3C → K2S + N2 + 3CO2 \nA more accurate, but still simplified[1], equation is\n\n10 KNO3 + 3S + 8C → 2K2CO3 + 3K2SO4 + 6 CO2 + 5N2 \nThe optimum proportions for gunpowder are: 74.64% saltpetre, 13.51% charcoal, and 11.85% sulfur (by mass). The current standard for black powder manufactured by pyrotechnicians today is 75% potassium nitrate, 15% softwood charcoal and 10% sulfur.",this text is about computers & internet,1,yahootopics,Computers & Internet,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

"Question: What happens to the other cardinals after POPE the 16th appointed the 15 new ones ,? Do the cardinals only have a term as long as the pope is alive ? Do the old cardinals  retire or what happens to them ? Is it true ONLY the newly elected cardinals are responsible and allowed to vote for the next pope (#17) after #16 has died?

Answer: Benedict the XVI means he is the 16th Pope to take the name Benedict since the beginning of the church...it has nothing to do with the number of cardinals.\n\nThe College of Cardinals is like the Supreme Court, appointed by the Pope but serve for life.  Cardinals serve for life, but can only vote for a new Pope if they are younger than 80 years old.\n\nSo to answer your questions in order...\n\n1. Nothing\n2.  No...they serve for life\n3.  No...there are almost 200 of them.\n4.  No, all cardinals under the age of 80 will be responsible for voting in the next pope.  There are 193 Cardinals and 120 of them are under 80 right now.\n\nThe next Pope won't necessarily be the 17th. The last one was the second (John Paul II).  If that Pope chooses the name of Benedict, (yes, they choose their own names) then he would be the 17th.  Otherwise, he will either be John Paul III or John the 27th or Peter II, depending what he chooses.",this text is about society & culture,0,yahootopics,Society & Culture,0,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

"Question: Who should i start this week Bulger or Rivers? Bulger has been suckn it up lately and the rams offensive line is hurting, but Rivers is at Denver this week so thats no walk in the park.  what do ya'll think?

Answer: I disagree with the others on this one.  I would go with Rivers.  I don't see L.T. having a great game against the Broncos, he never does in Denver.  The Chargers will go to the pass alot this week because thats how you beat the Broncos (they're #2 against the run, but 27th against the pass).  Yes, Tomlinson is on fire, but if the Chargers offense is anything it's versatile, they won't stick with the run if it isn't working.  And Rivers is not in a slump, GoMichigan doesn't know what he's talking about, Rivers threw for 337 yards and 3 TD's with no ints last week, and he was an offensive player of the week nominee.  Bulger is coming off his worst game of the season, and going up against a Panthers defense that has been very good against the pass this year.",this text is about family & relationships,1,yahootopics,Family & Relationships,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

It would be like screening the elderly for sexually transmitted diseases...lots of screening with very little result.\n\nThe problem is not that we are not finding heart disease if we are looking, its that there are plenty of people in their 50's and 60's who think that smoking, high blood pressure, elevated cholesterol, diabetes, and a strong family history are nothing to worry about...and oh yeah, this chest tightness isn't that bad, therefore it must not be anything.

"Question: can i layoff an employee and rehire another for the same job? basically, I am asking this from the employers standpoint, but I want to know if I can be laidoff & receive benifits, while my employer rehires for my job with a different title & wage attached.

Answer: There are two differences between being laid off and being terminated, is how you are treated for the purposes of unemployment insurance. \n\n1. A person who is laid off is entitled to unemployment compensation benefits, while a person who is terminated for a justifiable reason, (i.e., ""for cause"") is not entitled, because that person brought the loss of employment on him/herself.\n\n2. A person who is laid off in a ""cause"" jurisdiction, i.e., a State in which an employee cannot be terminated for a reason unrelated to their employment, is entitled to sue for ""wrongful termination,"" if the employee can show that the employer used the layoff as a means of avoiding the cause requirement associated with a termination.\n\nHowever in an ""at-will"" jurisdiction, an employer needs no reason to terminate an employee, and the only time that an employee can sue for wrongful termination is where there is a strong public interest in ensuring that employees are not terminated for unjust reasons, such as where an employee is terminated for revealing an employer's discriminatory hiring practices.\n\nOther than the above, being laid off and being terminated are exactly the same. There is no implied warranty that you will be rehired for the same job.\n\nSo, in order to answer your question, you would need to know if you are employed in a ""cause"" jurisdiction. If you are, you may have a case for wrongful termination. Otherwise, you probably don't.\n\nBut, if you're concerned, see an employment lawyer licensed to practice in your jurisdiction.",this text is about politics & government,1,yahootopics,Politics & Government,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

"Question: How to get a personal loan for low interest (sometime, without any interest)? I am in need of a Personal Loan of US $ 1000/- only.\nI can give a reasonable guarentee and assurance.\nKindly let me have a reasoble and accepted interest rate.\n(If possible, free of interest).  I can give proper guarantee to the party.  Please contact me on mh mobile : 00971502243765.  My e-mail : jabarsadiq@hotmail.com\nThanking you in anticipation.

Answer: I have recently heard about savings secured loans, which use your savings account as collateral.  It is one of the best deals around, because at the end of the loan period, you still have savings.  It works like this:  you pay a particular amount to the bank (usually a credit union), say 5% for the loan; in the meantime, you earn interest on your savings account, say 2.5%.  When you pay off the bank, your savings is freed up, and you have really only paid 2.5% interest for the loan.  The only drawback I can foresee is if you don't have any savings to begin with.",this text is about computers & internet,1,yahootopics,Computers & Internet,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

Answer: Producers don't buy ideas! You can't even get them copyrighted. You need an outline of each idea, what its about, the characters outline, how the idea story begins, developes and ends. You will then need an agent. If the idea is good enough the agent & you go before a panel at the studio and you have 5 minutes to pitch your idea from memory. If they like it and want you to rewrite it (usually as a script) you get $50,000 to develop it. You really need to take a screenwriting course at a community college.

"Question: Can anyone tell me what my glasses prescription means? I went to the optician today and I need to get some glasses. I have some basic knowledge about ophthalmology as I'm about to be a doctor, so I know the basics about how light focuses on the eye etc etc. And I understand the basic concept of astigmatism and how the eye is shaped more lke a rugby ball than a football....\n\nAnyway, my prescription from the optician is:\n\nR: SPH -1.00  CYL -0.50   Axis 115\nL:  SPH -1.25  CYL - 0.50  Axis  90\n\nI understand that it shows myopia in both eyes, left slightly worse than right, but what do the other numbers mean? It's something to do with the degree of astigmatism, but what do they actually show? And what does that mean in terms of my eyes?\n\nJust interested!!!

Answer: SPH = SPHERE\n The amount of long or short sightedness. It always has a plus (+) or a minus (-) sign in front or above it. If the vision in one eye is very poor, the word 'balance' or 'bal' may be written.  For example, i'm -3.00 in both right and left. So baisically, it tells you how blind you are\n\nCYL = CYLINDER (Astigmatism) This is the measure for astigmatism. Again, there is always a plus (+) or minus (-) sign present\n\nAXIS - This will only appear if there is a value for cylinder, as it relates to the cylindrical lens. It will be a number between 1 and 180. It may or may not be written with a degree 'o' symbol after the number. \n\n\nHope this helps",this text is about sports,1,yahootopics,Sports,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

"Question: Who is considered at the best Prime Minister in the history of Canada? I would say Pierre Elliot Trudeau is the best Prime Minister in the History of Canada.

Answer: Pierre Trudeau is certainly the Prime Minister who is most remembered and brought about a great deal of positive change - a multicultural, tolerant, understanding, bi-lingual society, good protection of our health care system, and repatriation of the constitution while maintaining good relations with Great Britain.  He greatly valued education and supported post secondary studies.  He is also remembered for the strong stand he took when he enacted the War Measures Act.  His phrase, ""Just watch me"" is often quoted.  Pierre Trudeau was a true statesman, something we have not seen in prime ministers since him.  Paul Martin and Stephen Harper do not even come close to having the statesmanship, diplomacy, integrity, resolution or just plain charisma of Pierre Trudeau.  He will go down in history as one of Canada's greatest.\n\nTo choose a runner up to Pierre Trudeau it would have to be either Lester Pearson who won a Nobel Peace Prize, or John A.

"Question: How about this proposal to alleviate some of the immigration problems in this country? Why don't we have all able bodied male and female illegal immigrants enlist in the military. We recruit people anyways from other countries. Send them to help out the problems in the mideast. At least these people can say they earned their place in this country honorably.\nThey would need to learn English and pay back taxes with interest. \nThey can send their families back to their own country and petition back after mandatory tour of duty.\nThose who cannot serve or wont serve will be automatically deported with no chance of coming back.\nThose who have a criminal record would also be deported.\nAlso welfare should be eliminated so that people on welfare can take the jobs that illegals are suppose to be taking.\nStricter border controls must be enforced. \nJust an idea.

Answer: I like some of your ideas. Enlisting foreigners in the military won't work because the military could easily get spies or traitors in it. I'm not sure because I'm not sure of the precautions the military takes. But if an illegal immigrant if forced to enter the army and is offered money to be a traitor, you see the temptation. They could hurt us alot that way. It is also possible that that use may help the us also. I'm not sure.\n\nI definetly like the idea of cutting off welfare. I have several members of my extended family on welfare, they could work, they just don't want do and want to eternally go to school to increase their eductation until they can get a easy, high paying job.\nBorder security must always be a main issue, a country is stupid to say ""welcome anyone without any security"" your welcoming invasion and crime.

"Question: Faith in Evolution?  Faith in creation? Some say that the evidence for evolution is overwhelming. Some say the same about creation. There are those who believe in creation because it's attached to their belief in God,even if they can only explain it in unscientific terms. Some believe in evolution because it's attached to their atheism, even if they've never read a book on the subject. Many believe in either evolution or creation simply because it's what they've been taught. Other views might include combining evolution and creation,perhaps with some emphasis on one or the other. Finally,some don't think about it at all.\n\nSince the same evidence(nature)is available to all,why are there so many different opinions? Does it require as much faith to believe in evolution as it does to believe in creation? Research has revealed a 'God' gene, hinting why some people believe in God. Is there an 'atheist' gene also?  What might this mean if it were true?

Answer: If God exists he must be rational as well as mind bogglingly powerful etc .\nA rational God would not want us to be slavish in our acceptance of him , because we are (more or less!) rational too.\nWe have entered the modern scientific age from an earlier stage where faith did not have to deal with awkward questions arising from the use of our rational minds .\nNot surprisingly this has put the religious apologists on the back foot .

"Question: How many pins does a computer's processor have? 

Answer: The number of pins on the package will vary by processor.\nHowever, by visiting:\n\nhttp://www.amd.com/us-en/Processors/TechnicalResources/0,,30_182_739_7203,00.html\n\nyou can look up most of the AMD processors.  You'll note\nthat the AMD processors fit into two packages: ""Socket 754""\nand ""Socket 940"".\n\nThe chips which uses ""Socket 754"", have 754 pins, and\nsimilarly, the chips which use the ""Socket 940"" has\n(approximately) 940 pins.  I say ""approximately"" because,\nfor example, the ""AMD Athlon 64X2 Dual-Core"" processor only\nimplements 939 pins (apparently leaving one unfilled in the\n940 socket).\n\nIf you visit the Intel site, you'll find that many of the \nPentiums (ie.

But now, its like everytime I do, I end up feeling sad. Or something is said that hurts my feelings. Its been happening for like two weeks.

Answer: The  Locust can increase extremely rapidly in numbers with the possibility of four generations through spring, summer, and autumn. It can form into dense aggregations (bands containing up to several thousand hoppers per square metre) as hoppers (the young locust before it can fly).The adults can form into swarms covering large areas and with upwards of 50 adults per square metre. They are formidable eating machines that can rapidly devastate crops. Their preferred food source is green grass or clover or lucerne but they have been recorded eating green leaves from many different plants.The highly mobile nature of swarms and their ability to migrate over large distances means that virtually all agricultural areas are at risk from damage.",this text is about society & culture,1,yahootopics,Society & Culture,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

"Question: difference between isotherm and heat equator? 

Answer: I would say an isotherm is a line connecting points having the same temperature.\n\nAnd the heat equator is the great circle lying just underneath the sun in a given short time period. To keep it thin, we'll pick one day and say the sun's rays are vertical at all points of the circle when it is noon at each of those points.\n\nThis equator would thus divide the earth into two equally heated halves over the given time period.\n\nDifference:  Temperatures not necessarily uniform along the heat equator, but are the same along an isotherm.\n\nBut I have not been through college, nor been trained with respect to these definitions, so I might be wrong.\n\nSometimes things can be arbitrary rather than appealing to some logical sense; however, that is less frequent in scientific disciplines.",this text is about society & culture,1,yahootopics,Society & Culture,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20
"Question: a real mind bender? If god is almighty, is it possible for him to create a rock he cannot lift? /:)

Answer: From a Hindu perspective : yes\n\nBrahman (God) manifested the entire universe from Itself and yet also Brahman pervades the universe. Thus the rock is Brahman and so all living beings in the universe. Thus, knowing that there are rocks so large the people cannot lift, Brahman has thus created Itself in the form of rocks that are so large that Itself in the form of people cannot lift.\n\nIf that makes sense.\n\nThe word Brahman is derived from two Sanskrit words Brih and Manah. Brih means ""great"" or ""expanding"" and Manah means ""consciousness"". Thus Brahman is ""Great Consciousness"" or ""Expanding Consciousness""...although is usually translated into English as ""Cosmic Consciousness"", ""Ultimate Reality"", ""Universal Soul"".",this text is about sports,1,yahootopics,Sports,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20
"Question: How do you feel when other people speak foreign language in front of you? I am a chinese and I usually dont speak that language in front of non-chinese, because I feel that is disrepect to others. Even I have a chinese co-worker in my company, we only speak English, unless no one around us.  Yesterday when I came home, I was about to pull my car in my parking space, some mexicans (who dont live in my building) parked his truck on my spot, so I gave him a honk.  Instead of pulling his car right out and apppologize, he turned his head and said something to his companion in spanish, I felt offended.  After I parked my car, I actually went to him and said, ""If you have some complain about me, speak English, this is America, not Mexico.""

Answer: Yes. It offends me. In my house, we speak English, because my best friend and myself are American. Italian, because my wife is Italian. Or Russian(at least we TRY to), because my friend's wife is from Russia. However, in public, we ALL speak English, and ONLY English.

"Question: Do the ends justify the means? So I'm writing a paper about the steel mills in Pittsburgh and the treatment of the workers and the modernist attitude of neglect towards the workers, and one of the things I notice, is that Carnegie especially believed that the ends justified the means, that if he did good work and was charitable, that would wipe out all of his earlier transgressions.\n\nAt the same time as he believed this, the Braddock mills had a twelve hour work day.  You worked all day or all night in the steel mills (doing dangerous manual labor) and then once a week you would work a twenty four hour shift in the mills.  You had every Sunday off.  \n\nThe death rate in the mills was much higher during the twenty four hour shift than other times, due to exhaustion.\n\nOn the other hand, those mills built America.  All the great railroads and early skyscrapers that fueled the American economy came out of there.\n\nSo do the ends (building America) justify the means (killing and maiming and maltreating workers)?

Answer: It is impossible to achieve moral ends through immoral means. Don't forget, those workers wouldn't have worked at the steel mill if they thought they could have gotten a better job someplace else, so Carnegie et. al. did those men a favor. Ditto for sneaker-making kids in Singapore. Before you go thinking I'm crazy, consider this: from 1750 to 1800(the advent of industrialism in England), the child mortality rate in London dropped 70%. I don't expect you to believe that, I expect you to check the facts yourself. In other words, John Bull saved the lives of many poor people. Isn't it better to work in a loud, dangerous machine shop, than to die of starvation? Also, if it weren't for the factories, there'd be no Labor party. Factory jobs lifted generations of people out of poverty and into the law-making middle class. In this case, the end is a better standard of living, and the means are hard work.

Well, of course I had to bring my kids, so I invited my friend to come with so she could help watch them while I got my deal. 10 minutes to 10 she takes the older ones to get movies about a half a block away, leaving me with a kicking and screaming 2 year old. Ya, I went to find her to ask what's up with that? By the time I got back, the dealer putting a new sticker on the windows of unoccupied vehicles, the van was now $1200. I was pissed, knowing that I was 30 seconds too late for a much cheaper price. Still at $1200, it was a steal. About 25 minutes later I come back with the money, only to see the price is now 12,411. Seems the second deal was only good for half hour. So ya, I was moody yesterday, but I am hoping that today goes much better!! \n\nI hope YOU have a great day too!!",this text is about politics & government,1,yahootopics,Politics & Government,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

As for the allegation of a bribe, sounds extremely hard to prove and most Bar Organizations won't look at past history as an indication of current ethical violations absent some proof.

I have had problems lately with one of the incisions healing and the doc said to stop smoking.....it is just so hard....obviously 5 is better than 30 but will 5 do that much harm?

Answer: you are right... 5 is better than 30.  30 is better than 40.  None is the best.  I smoked and then only had 1 cigarette in July each year.  The mistake about it all is that unlike eating which you can't stop, smoking can be. \n\nMy doctor explained the problem as the effects of one cigarette might be to elevate your blood pressure by constricting your blood vessels.   Not good if you have high blood pressure since the problems compound.  \n\nIf 5 did no harm, how could 5 cigarettes taken 6 times a day hurt you?

"Question: prove lcm(m,n) = m*n/gcd(m,n)? 

Answer: Its equivalent to proving\nm*n = (lcm(m,n) ) * ( gcd(m,n) )\n\nNow, i'll have to use basic number theory. The idea is to show that the number of times a prime factor of m*n occurs on the LHS is equal to the number of times a prime factor of (lcm(m,n) ) * ( gcd(m,n) ) occurs on the RHS.\nNote : LHS = Left Hand Side\n       RHS = Right Hand Side\n\nFor any prime factor p of m*n, call it p. Now say p occurs to the power of h in m and power of k in n. That is to say m ""contains"" p^h while n contains p^k. Note that h,k are nonnegative integers. \n\nNow, in lcm(m,n), we would choose p^ [ min(h,k) ] while\nin gcd(m,n) we would choose  p^ [ max(h,k) ]   \nNote that min (h,k) means minimum of h and k, similarly  max (h,k)means maximum of h and k . For example, if h=2 and k=3, then min (2,3) = 2. while max(2,3) = 3. If say h = k, then obviously in both lcm and gcd of m*n we choose p^h to be in its product. This is true for EVERY prime factor of m*n.\n\nSo, consider the product (lcm(m,n) ) * ( gcd(m,n) ).\nFor EACH prime factor p of m*n, we have shown above that it occurs as { p^ [ min(h,k) ] } * { p^ [ max(h,k) ]   }, that is our RHS product contains \n  p^ [ min(h,k) +  max(h,k) ] = p^(h+k)\nNow, in our LHS, p occurs as p^h * p^k = p^(h+k) too!!!\nThus, we have shown for each prime factor, p of m*n, it occurs as the same product in both the LHS and RHS. And thus\nwe have LHS = RHS. Done.\n\nOne question may circle in your mind, that is how i know that [ min(h,k) +  max(h,k) ] = (h+k)\nWell, this is a fact.\n\nFurther, if you want to show it, consider 3 cases.\n\nCase 1. ( h = k)\nHere min(h,k) = min(h,h) = h\nand  max(h,k) = max(h,h) = h\nSo, [ min(h,k) +  max(h,k) ] = h + h = 2h.\nAnd (h+k)= h + h = 2h.\n\nCase 2. ( h < k)\nHere min(h,k) =  h, because h is smaller.\nand  max(h,k) = k, because k is bigger.\nSo, [ min(h,k) +  max(h,k) ] = h + k \n\nCase 3. ( h > k )\nHere min(h,k) =  k, because k is smaller.\nand  max(h,k) = h, because h is bigger.\nSo, [ min(h,k) +  max(h,k) ] = k + h",this text is about science & mathematics,0,yahootopics,Science & Mathematics,0,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

"Question: Will it look bad on my credit report if I agree to a settlement offer? I have a credit card debt. I have been offered a settlement of 60%.\nThe letter says that once paid, they will consider the account settled in full. What will that look like on my credit report and how will it affect it negatively?

Answer: I am a former financial counselor for a consolidation firm in Orlando so I can answer your question. Whenever you get a settlement offer from a collection agency or a creditor, you have to way the pro's and con's of your decisions. Two big factors determine your credit score: 35% is payment history, and 30% is overall debt. Based on these two factors, by making a setlement you're score will increase somewhat because you are satisfying the debt with that creditor, but may not increase as much as if you paid off the entire debt completely. Score may not be your only concern, because future lenders will see the special status of settlement for this debt which lenders frown upon. It's as if you borrowed $100 from a friend and only decided to pay him/her back $60! It satisfies your friend who you owed the money that they got anything back at all, but don't go asking other friends for money, you already have a reputation! \n\nSo in summary, if your financial situation only allows you to pay a settled amount, then by all means pay it. That collector at least will stop calling your house asking for money (PS make sure to get the offer in writing as described above). But remember this, negative credit history can remain on your credit report for a length of 7-10 years. Or your other alternative is to slowly pay off the debt by making smaller payments. If it's with a collection agency, then they probably aren't charging interest and you are already used to their collection tactics. You may be able to pay it off sooner than 7-10 years, and remember they will show ""satisfied"" on your report instead of ""settled"" which is much better.",this text is about health,1,yahootopics,Health,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

"Question: what is some negative impacts of the tv in our personal life? 

Answer: What are the harmful aspects of TV ? \n\nTV displaces active types of recreation:\nIt decreases time spent playing with peers. A child has less time for self-directed daydreaming and thinking. It takes away time for participating in sports, music, art, or other activities that require practice to achieve competence. \n\nTV interferes with conversation and discussion time:\nIt reduces social interactions with family and friends. \n\nTV discourages reading: \nReading requires much more thinking than television. Reading improves a youngster's vocabulary. A decrease in reading scores may be related to too much time in front of the TV. \n\nHeavy TV viewing (more than 4 hours a day) definitely reduces school performance: \nThis much TV interferes with study, reading, and thinking time. If children do not get enough sleep because they are watching TV, they will not be alert enough to learn well on the following day. \n\nTV discourages exercise:\nAn inactive life-style leads to poor physical fitness. If accompanied by frequent snacking, watching TV may contribute to weight problems. \n\nTV advertising encourages a demand for material possessions: \nYoung children will pressure their parents to buy the toys they see advertised. TV portrays materialism as the ""American way."" \n\nTV violence can affect how a child feels toward life and other people:\nViewing excessive violence may cause a child to be overly fearful about personal safety and the future. TV violence may numb the sympathy a child normally feels toward victims of human suffering. Young children may be more aggressive in their play after seeing violent television shows. While TV violence does not increase aggressive behavior toward people in most children, it may do so in disturbed or impulsive children.",this text is about politics & government,1,yahootopics,Politics & Government,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

At least these people can say they earned their place in this country honorably.\nThey would need to learn English and pay back taxes with interest. \nThey can send their families back to their own country and petition back after mandatory tour of duty.\nThose who cannot serve or wont serve will be automatically deported with no chance of coming back.\nThose who have a criminal record would also be deported.\nAlso welfare should be eliminated so that people on welfare can take the jobs that illegals are suppose to be taking.\nStricter border controls must be enforced. \nJust an idea.

Answer: I like some of your ideas. Enlisting foreigners in the military won't work because the military could easily get spies or traitors in it. I'm not sure because I'm not sure of the precautions the military takes. But if an illegal immigrant if forced to enter the army and is offered money to be a traitor, you see the temptation. They could hurt us alot that way. It is also possible that that use may help the us also. I'm not sure.\n\nI definetly like the idea of cutting off welfare. I have several members of my extended family on welfare, they could work, they just don't want do and want to eternally go to school to increase their eductation until they can get a easy, high paying job.\nBorder security must always be a main issue, a country is stupid to say ""welcome anyone without any security"" your welcoming invasion and crime. Criminal illegal aliens should definetly be deported.",this text is about politics & government,0,yahootopics,Politics & Government,0,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

"Question: what are the purpose and the danger of fiberglass at home? 

Answer: Fiberglass is useful for a lot of different things including thermal insulation; acoustic insulation; fireproofing; reinforcement of plastics, cement, and textiles; gaskets and seals; etc.\n\nIt's danger stems from from its size, with a fiberglass filament commonly 3 microns in diameter and 20 or more microns in length. At that size it's been shown to be a potent carcinogen and causes nearly identical symptoms as that of asbestosis (a form of lung cancer).",this text is about computers & internet,1,yahootopics,Computers & Internet,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20
"Question: Constant severe life-ruining abdominal bloating? I haven't seen my real tummy since June. Occasionally I wake up almost normal but stress or any food bloats me up huge. I've seen 10-12 doctors. \n\nHere's whats been ruled out, and I'm SERIOUS: food allergies, dairy (I'm VEGAN,) H. Pylori, ovarian cysts, fibroids, Candida, blood in stool, parasites, acid stomach.\n\nWhat I DO have: gallstones. I had an ERCP where my sphincter of Oddi was found to be closed shut tight. A sphincterotomy relieved pain in the general area but NOT general stomach pain (gnawing) and bloating.\n\nI don't have ""attacks,"" I can eat fatty foods with no problems at all but I dont often. I suspect my stones are actually silent stones and the bloating is something else. I had one small stone when I got the first ultrasound, 3 days after the bloating began. Now I have ""several."" I can't concentrate on work or school, so depressed. Any ideas on causes or remedies? Please no answers involving not swallowing air or eating and drinking at the same time or eating large meals.

Answer: Have they tested for Celiac Disease? CD can cause severe abdominal bloating. Do you have any other symptoms other than the pain and bloating?

"Question: Why Does The Military Have So Many Stupid Rules Against Recruits Joining? Like no tatoos, no asthma, no mood disorders, no flat feet, etc.?\n\nI've seen all sorts of Marines with crazy tatoos, and there are definitely plenty of crazy people, no doubt. If someone wants to join and they're not evidently unfit, what's the problem?

Answer: 1) Many tattoos are gained in prison, through gangs, etc.  Specifically targetting such people has resulted in lawsuits, so they just say ""no tattoos"".\n2) Asthma?  You want to be defended by someone who keels over when the going gets tough or has to pull out their medicine in a firefight?  That's silly!\n3) Mood disorders?  Why would anyone hire someone like that?  Why should they have to?\n4) Flat feet interfere with movement, slowing them down.  I don't know about you but I wouldn't want someone slowing down the unit just because they insist on being in the military despite their problems.  Shall we add quadraplegics?  How about children?\n\nBecause the take the best to defend our country with their lives, and most can't afford to deal with additional problems such as you name.  They are already dealing with seditious traitors like you often see in responses to posts like this one by people too cowardly to join.  I was too cowardly to join, but I know a hero when I see one.

I'm taking Claritin for my histeric hives which suggests to take only 1 tablet (Anti-histamin 10mg) in 24 hours but I've taken 6 tablets already in 24 hours and now I need to take one more since itchness comes up again and hives come to even my face.\n\nI'm on steroid and got prescription of Benadryl but refused to take Benadryl since it makes me way too sleepy and take Claritin instead. But itchness comes back per 3~4 hours so had to take them pretty often then made me to take 6 tablets a day which is 6 times more than I should take.\n\nI'm worry about over-dose effect and side effect. My doc said a shot works as same as taking pills but should I go back to the doc to ask a shot no matter what??\n\nThank you all in advance ;-)

As for the allegation of a bribe, sounds extremely hard to prove and most Bar Organizations won't look at past history as an indication of current ethical violations absent some proof.

"Question: I am looking for any info on copyright laws for recipes, products (tortes,pies) or ideas involving baked goods I am a pastry chef 18+ yrs, and someone wants to start a bakery using my ideas etc...But she also wants anything that we use in production to be Hers ( the bakery's ) with out letting me use it to make a profit in the future.an example would  be like this... We want to add a new torte to the production, so I come up with the recipe, flavor combination and overall design and look of the new torte. I then proceed to teach all of the employees how to efficently produce the torte for sales. Say, I might do this hundreds times over. Next... It's a big hit, we make tons of money, maybe I have enough to take the plunge in my own sm business. But... I can't use anything I've created in the past because now it ""belongs"" to her company... How do I protect myself????\n Recipes, creations of flavors, designes,are all being questioned. She ownes the company, but I would be the company. Can I legally protect myself for a future business that I may own someday? Thanks AJ

Answer: If you work for her then what you make is legally hers unless you have a contract stating otherwise.  Remember you're not making the idea as yourself, but as an employee.  \n\nIt sounds like you want her to take the risk, but then you profit if it works.  I'm sorry but I don't think that's right.  If you came up with an idea and tried it out on your own and not at someone elses bakery I'd feel that you should profit from it.  \n\nBottom line is if you're not the one willing to take the risk then you shouldn't be the one to profit.  Unless she's willing to allow you to keep your products then I'd find another way to produce them.  Open your own business and find bakeries willing to be sold ""use"" rights for your tort, etc  In this way you don't need to be making them and you clearly own the rights to the recipe.  You could then even offer to ""consult"" with the employees on how to actually cook them, etc.",this text is about health,1,yahootopics,Health,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

Answer: Because all they see is the tv, nintendo or pc. Blame their parents.  Monkey see, monkey do.  If the parents are active and creative then the children will be too.  I see this in very young children.  My kid is 16 mos. and loves to watch (and chase) birds, pick flowers, throw balls, play on the swing set, and 'read'.  When she goes to the daycare for an hour while I work out she plays with the toys (what a novel idea!) while most of the other kids her age are zoned out to the boob tube.

"Question: Heart attack; what are my chances of dieing of a heart attack when i grow up? im 16, my father past away feb. 23rd 2006 of a amssive heart attack and my grandma died of a massive heart attack, both on my dad's side...is there any chance i will also have a bad heart when i grow up? i already have medical problems...i have a sleep apnea, a spinal cord problem and many alergies to different things, but most of those don't matter, im just very afraid of having a bad heart....could someone help me possibly?

Answer: Dear Bobo:\n\nI think it is very natural to feel worried about a heart attack if one's father has just died of one a couple of months ago. \n\nHere is my answer:\n\nFIRST: You ARE worried; the question is, SHOULD you be worried? \n\nThe answer is more difficult than just statistics. If you want statistics, cardiac risk, i.e. the risk of a heart attack can be easily calculated:\n\nhttp://hp2010.nhlbihin.net/atpiii/calculator.asp\n\nBut as it states, this calculator, which is used nearly universally by physicians, applies only for those age 20 or greater. Why is that? Because the heart is like pump -- like any mechanical thing, be it one's car or one's sneakers, it wears out over time, and the older one is, the more likely one is have one's heart give out. Since 20 year olds rarely die of heart attacks (i.e. unless you do crack, etc), its not possible to calculate the odds for the ""average"" 16 year old.\n\nSECOND: What IS a heart attack? Generally, it implies a blockage of one of the arteries supplying blood to the heart. The heart, like any muscle, or any machine, requires fuel -- in this case, oxygen, which is supplied to it by the piping called coronary arteries. When these get plugged up, like any pipe, what is needed can't get through. When this happens to living tissue, the tissue dies. In the case of the heart, as it is the main (and only) pump supplying blood to the rest of the body, if the damage is servere enough, then the pump (i.e. heart) completely fails, the entire body is starved of oxygen, and one passes away.\n\nWhat, then, makes one more likely to have a heart attack? Many things, such as genetics, i.e. a family history of heart disease. But, from this discription, anything that stresses or clogs the piping (arteries) to the heart -- i.e. causes heart disease, also known as atherosclerosis. Stuff like high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes (sugar in the piping, like sugar-water on the table, is sticky and gums up the works), high cholesterol, obesity (which is often a cause of SLEEP APNEA), all increase one's risk.\n\nGenerally, when a healthy 16 year old walks into a doctor's office asking, am i at risk for a heart attack, the physician will likely wonder why the patient is asking, rather than being worried about the patient actually being at risk.\n\nWhich brings me to YOUR question: ""could somebody help me?"" \n\n-- the answer I think is: please, please consider talking to a counselor at your school; friends, siblings, a hotline, a doctor. You are worried about your mortality; And right after a family member has died, more so. It's natural, but often, it helps to talk about it. \n\nGo ask your doctor this question, and see what she or he has to say. It'll be worth it. As for heart disease, see your doctor regularly over the years, listen to their advice, and . . .\n\nKeep well, keep healthy.\n\n-------\n\nDisclaimers: \n\nIn addition to the disclaimers already stated by Yahoo.com: \n\nNOTE: The information communicated here does not constitute or imply a patient-doctor interaction or relationship; the reader and/or recipient of any ""answer"" agrees to hold the writer harmless from any loss, harm, injury or damage resulting from or arising out of your submission of the question or your use of or reliance on any response thereto.\n\nAs Stated: Yahoo!

"Question: if everyone abandoned monotheism, would there be less war? 

Answer: No.\n\nHumans war because humans are violent, competetive creatures. They fight each other DESPITE religion, not BECAUSE of it. If they DO fight ""because"" of their religion, this is just one of the many things people fight over, and in its absence they probably would've found something else to fight over.\n\nSome hard evidence for you is that there are and have been many societies that are NOT monotheistic, but war frequently. One example is feudal Japan, which was in a state of constant warfare for centuries before any monotheistic religion was introduced. We're talking serious, constant warfare between ""nobles"" in which great armies of men died, and this went on for centuries. Ancient Greece/Rome also warred without any monotheism in their culture. We also see tribal warfare among tribes who worship multiple spirits/gods.

"Question: list and describe the conturbution of the scienits who devolped the elements of the peroidc table? 

Answer: From Wikipedia.org:\n\n""first devised in 1869 by the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev. Mendeleev intended the table to illustrate recurring (""periodic"") trends in the properties of the elements.""\n\n""The original table was created before the discovery of subatomic particles or the formulation of current quantum mechanical theories of atomic structure. If one orders the elements by atomic mass, and then plots certain other properties against atomic mass, one sees an undulation or periodicity to these properties as a function of atomic mass. The first to recognize these regularities was the German chemist Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner who, in 1829, noticed a number of triads of similar elements:\nSome triads Element Molar mass\n(g/mol) Density\n(g/cm³) Quotient\n(cm³/mol)\nchlorine 35.4527 0.003214 11030\nbromine 79.904 3.122 25.6\niodine 126.90447 4.93 25.7\n \ncalcium 40.078 1.54 26.0\nstrontium 87.62 2.64 33.2\nbarium 137.327 3.594 38.2\n\nThis was followed by the English chemist John Newlands, who noticed in 1865 that the elements of similar type recurred at intervals of eight, which he likened to the octaves of music, though his law of octaves was ridiculed by his contemporaries. Finally, in 1869, the German Julius Lothar Meyer and the Russian chemistry professor Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev almost simultaneously developed the first periodic table, arranging the elements by mass. However, Mendeleev plotted a few elements out of strict mass sequence in order to make a better match to the properties of their neighbours in the table, corrected mistakes in the values of several atomic masses, and predicted the existence and properties of a few new elements in the empty cells of his table. Mendeleev was later vindicated by the discovery of the electronic structure of the elements in the late 19th and early 20th century.\n\nIn the 1940s Glenn T. Seaborg identified the transuranic lanthanides and the actinides, which may be placed within the table, or below (as shown above).""",this text is about politics & government,1,yahootopics,Politics & Government,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

"Question: What would you do if your best friend called you a Momma's Girl/Momma's Boy? What if your best friend said that they got it from a ""movie"". And they actually made a reason why you are a Momma's Girl/Momma's Boy. Here are some of my friends I asked:\n\nI would punch them in the face.\n -Tiffeny V.\n\nI would be mad at them.\n -Abigail Q.\n\nThat's hella mean I wouldnt be their friend no more.\n -Jana Khun

Answer: I think you came to the right place for advice. Your friends gave you advice that will only get you in trouble. Thank them for their opinions, but try doing this instead:\n\n1. I'd sit down alone and write out some possible reasons my friend said that. Then I'd ask myself, ""Is this a normal way to behave for someone my age?"" I would be honest with myself. (my guess is that you are completely normal)\n\n2. Then, I'd stop and think about the day when my Mom would no longer be alive...(my mother is very ill right now, dying of a disease) And, I'd realize then:\n\n""My friends can just shove it!

"Question: Why do people have problems applying for SSI? I recentlty had to apply for SSI/Disability and did so about 3 months ago.  My case worker said I had 0 errors on my application and it was the first time she had ever seen that.  I hear of stories where people get denied, go through appeals, have to hire attornies and this is years later for the same situation as myself.  I heard today I was approved and will take 30 days to get money but it has only been 3 months.  I find it hard to believe that it is so hard for some people in the same boat I am.  Why is it hard?  What are the denial reasons people get?

Answer: I was diagnosed with MS May '05.  I applied for SSI last October, and was approved for Presumptive Disability.  I received 3 checks, then they denied me.  I appealed, and was denied again.  Now I am on the third appeal.  I hired a retired Social Security representative, and will be going before an administrative law judge within the next 2 months.  He told me that was just the way it was.  So many people get denied the first time, and never appeal, that Social Security tries its best to screw you.

Answer: ""Allimony in the state of Illinois? I'm about to divorce my husband, he dont know this yet. But I know i will get child support but i was wondering about alimony. My PT job brings me about $4,000.00 a year, only 4 thousand, no typo. And because he never wanted me to work more than that, I think I would be entitled to spousal support. His job and income always provided for me, now because of his lying and cheating, I'm walking out on ten years of marriage. Am i elligable for alimony according to IL law?""\n\nThe quick answer to your question is ""Probably.""\n\nThe basic purpose of maintenance is to allow spouses who were supported during the marriage-- but who are unable to support themselves after dissolution of the marriage-- to be able to have time to establish a fair degree of independence.  Consequently, maintenance payments for a year or two-- depending on the particular circumstances of the case-- might be warranted where the previously supported spouse is actively pursuing employment, job training or advanced education, where the other spouse has the financial means to provide such support,  and where the division of assets has not created a financial situation that provides a means of support already.\n\nFor example, if a previously supported spouse gets custody of children and is consequently awarded possession of the marital residence until the children reach the age of majority (when the house will be sold and the proceeds divided between the ex-spouses), then the other spouse's support of the residence might negate the need for maintenance payments.  Also, any large lump sum distributions of funds might do the same.\n\nKeep in mind, however, that Marital Settlement Agreements often include a waiver of maintenance-- and other provisions that severe ties as much as possible.  You do want to get DIVORCED, right?  The attorney fees, court costs and general headaches of trying to get paid maintenance sometimes outweigh the benefits of getting it.\n\n[This is not legal advice.

Shoes in left hand to avoid waking his wife, he tiptoed as quietly as he could toward the stairs leading to their upstairs bedroom, but misjudged the bottom step in the darkened entryway. As he caught himself by grabbing the banister, his body swung around and he landed heavily on his rump. \n\nA whiskey bottle in each back pocket broke and made the landing especially painful. Managing to suppress a yelp, he sprung up, pulled down his pants and examined his lacerated and bleeding cheeks in the mirror of a nearby darkened hallway, then managed to find a large full box of band aids before proceeding to place a patch as best he could on each place he saw blood.\n\nAfter hiding the now almost empty box, he managed to shuffle and stumble his way to bed. Morning, he awakens with screaming pain in head and butt to find his wife staring at him from across the room, and hears her say: ""You were drunk again last night!!!"" \n\nForcing himself to ignore his agony, he looked meekly at her and replied: ""Now Hon, why would you say such a mean thing?""

Answer: The UN is a nice idea - you know, a friendly little angel that watches over and makes sure everyone plays nice with each other - but in all the years the UN has been in existence it has failed to intervene because conflicts have either been deemed ""domestic issues"" (like civil wars/genocides) that they can't get involved with or they have failed to follow through on their own resolutions. It doesn't work because the system is bad and because different countries can block actions that don't suit their interests - for example the UN did nothing to stop the Cold War because both the US and Russia were a part of the decision-making team and couldn't pass resolutions over the other.

Answer: Simple answer: The ""sinful"" condition of homosexuality can not be proven or disproven, one way or another.\n\nComplex Answer: Sin is a concept presented by religion, which is based in faith, not science.

"Question: What political party do you belong to and why? I am an American Independant.Which for me means I can go either way on the issues and the politicians.I am a Moderate with liberal leanings on some issues.I did not vote for Bush-Both times but would vote for McCain.I am for gay rights and womens rights and human rights.I am for gun rights and belong to the NRA.I am for the death penalty and I am for strong anti ILEGAL immigration...You?

Answer: None. I, too, am an Independent. I refuse to pigeon-hole myself to fall into one group or the other when both are filled with lying crooks. I tend to lean on the liberal side socially and the conservative (not neo-con) side fiscally. \n\nI am for any rights guaranteed by the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. This includes the ""all men are created equal"" part. Gay rights, women's rights, minority rights, the right to bear arms, freedom of speech and religion - all of these were directly or indirectly mentioned in these documents, which form the basis of our society. \n\nI am for the death penalty if it is used fairly and is non-discriminatory.\n\nI am for welfare if it is a temporary assistance program and not a lifelong handout. \n\nI am for a balanced budget. Every American needs to balance their budget, why can't America?\n\nI am against foreign intervention and foreign aid, except where our national security is at risk, or for humanitarian purposes. I am opposed to torture and “extraordinary rendition”, because it lowers us to the level of terrorists. I am opposed to the US denial of Geneva Convention rights to Prisoners-of-War. \n\nI did not vote for Bush, and would not vote for McCain, either. I used to like McCain before he started ""stumping"" for the man who insulted him, calling him a ""senator-for-sale"" and saying he abandoned fellow veterans. I lost all respect for him after that. I have said I might vote for Murtha or Kucinich, but, truthfully, I have yet to see a candidate who is worthy of the job.",this text is about health,1,yahootopics,Health,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20
"Question: my boths hands small fingers are feeling numb? 

Answer: Do you tend to rest your head in your hands?  Lean on one arm and then the other while sitting?  Lean your elbows on the armrests in your vehicle?  How about reading/doing homework while stretched out on the floor, leaning on  your elbows?\n\nNot all hand numbness indicates carpal tunnel syndrome.  What you describe is a common experience for freelance writers like myself.  We tend to suffer pinched nerves in our elbows, which demonstrate numbness in the pinky fingers, then heels of the hand (the portion of hand under the pinky to the wrist), then up the bottom part of the forearm.  As the nerve becomes more and more pinched, more fingers, hand portions and forearm become affected.\n\nI suggest you first notice what you're doing with your arms.  Refrain from leaning whenever you notice you do so.  The physical therapy other writers and I have been assigned to relieve such numbness is simple:\n\n1.  While standing with your feet hip-width apart, slightly tuck pelvis (tighen tummy to support lower back), stretch top-back of head toward the ceiling (slightly jut out chin, then lower chin to feel the strectch in the spine), roll shoulders up, back, down (breast-bone will feel lifted) and hold position.\n\n2.  While arms are at sides, turn out affected arm's hand, slowly raise up arm, bend foream down so elbow is pointing at ceiling and hand points down back.\n\n3.  With the opposite hand, pull raised elbow behind head (your head may slightly move ahead as you do this).\n\n4.  Repeat on other side if necessary.\n\nNext, while standing with both arms down in that beginning position; \n\n1.  Raise affected arm straight out to the side.\n\n2.  Slowly, without turning torso, move arm across chest so the fingers point to opposite side (if you are tight in the shoulders, you may not be able to get your arm to go very far...not a problem).\n\n3.  With the opposite hand, pull raised arm into chest.\n\n4.  Repeat on opposite side as needed.\n\nAt night, notice whether or not you are sleeping on one side, falling asleep on  your side with one arm under the pillow and your head resting on that side.\n\nIf you are, then do what you can to change up your falling-asleep position for a while.  You may very well wake up in the position you attempted to change, but you will have at least spared your body some crushed nerve time in the process.\n\nTry these exercises for a week or so.  Take anti-imflammatory ibuprofen.  If you still do not experience any relief, then visit your doctor.",this text is about society & culture,1,yahootopics,Society & Culture,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

"Question: What is the real difference between a Tasco Riflescope and a Leupold, other than image clarity? I want to know if in reality a cheap scope will affect so much my rifle accuracy to spend $500 - $1000 in a scope.  If they are really so bad what is the difference.\n\nRemember I'm not talking about image quality that I know will be better in a more expensive scope but for Bench Rest Shooting this is not as important as accuracy ( Shoot to Shoot repeatability)

Answer: Two main differences, both related:\n\nOne, the Tasco scopes usually have 1-inch main tubes and many (most?) Leupolds have 30mm tubes. That extra 5mm means extra elevation adjustment before your stadia (the thing that holds the reticle) hits the side of the scope.\n\nSecondly, the Tasco has two adjustment knobs; one for elevation and one for windage. But the configuration is like this: One knob at 12 o'clock, one at 3 o'clock, and one spring at 7:30 to press the stadia against the adjustment knobs. It's a common configuration, but it means that as you adjust the windage, the elevation can change as well. Leupold uses 2 springs placed 180 degrees from the adjustment knobs - so a knob at 12 and 3, and a spring at 6 and 9. It makes the scope more repeatable as you make adjustments.\n\nIf all you want to do is sight in your rifle at, say, 200 yards and then shoot a deer or two a season, the Tasco will do just fine. if, however, you're dinging clay pigeons at 700 yards with a quartering wind you'll want the scope that can perform for you.\n\nA really simple test of a scope's adjustment mechanism is to shoot a 3-shot group at the center of a large piece of cardboard - right at a target dot. Then move your windage a few minutes of angle to the right - I like to move it 6 minutes, or 24 clicks on a 1/4 moa scope. Place the reticle on the same target dot, and press the trigger 3 times. Now adjust your elevation 6 minutes up and repeat, then 6 minutes left, then 6 minutes down. You should have a perfect square defined by the 5 groups you shot, with the group in the lower left being 6 holes and the others being 3. If you have anything but a square, or your ending group isn't at the same place as your beginning group, your scope has a repeatability problem when adjusted.",this text is about entertainment and music,1,yahootopics,Entertainment & Music,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

"Question: How did Athena impact The Odessey? 

Answer: Oh, wow are you lucky.I'm way good at that book. Here's one of the lectures I have. E-mail me at n00b_school_bus@yahoo.com if you need more.\n\n Lecture on November 3, 2005\n\n Odysseus is about 45 – 55 years old. The beggar appears to be 65 – 75 years old. He is ugly, poor, sickly thin and has loose saggy skin. Odysseus is disguised as the beggar so people don’t recognize him. Athena helps with the disguise.\n Odysseus’ dog recognizes him. Beggar looks older than Odysseus; he is extremely ugly. Odysseus’ disguise is to fool the suitors so they don’t recognize him. He doesn’t want Ithaca to recognize him. He wants to know if they are loyal. The dog recognizes him, even with him away because of his scent. Dog= symbol of Ithaca. He was a great dog before Odysseus left, and then he “fell apart” when Odysseus went to war”. Odysseus trained the dog. After Odysseus left, nobody was latched on to the dog, even though he has such a great potential. The dog got old and is dying. It’s literally laying on its own feces whist dying. It symbolizes Ithaca going to crap. Ithaca’s potential has never been realized. They could have been great but nobody seized the opportunity to govern the city. Although the dog dies, there is hope. The city can be restored. Even though the dog dies, Ithaca won’t because Odysseus is there.  Ithaca is ruled by Sparta. People who were loyal to Odysseus remained loyal. The suitors must die.\n Penelope wanted to unstring a bow to see if anyone of the suitors could restring it. She knew that the only person able to do that was Odysseus. 70 year old ugly beggar asked for the bow. Penelope and her maid made the axe shooter (see picture). She (Penelope) is repulsed by the young men suitors so much that she would be just as happy to marry the old beggar. One young suitor is drinking wine and starts laughing and Odysseus (disguised as the beggar) as he inspects the bow. Odysseus effortlessly strings the bow. The young suitors think he’s crazy and are shocked.  Odysseus drops on one knee and shoots…the arrow goes through all 12 axe handle hooks.\n Antinous tries to, and does, beat Telemachus. Odysseus tells Telemachus to keep his head and turns back in to Odysseus in his 45 year old form. The suitors are yelling at Odysseus, saying that he is going to die but they realize they have no weapons. Odysseus: “You dared bid for my wife while I was still alive”.  This is where they start to get afraid. “Their eyes flickered looking for some hutch or hide away from death”. Odysseus tries to and does kill everyone. The Gods are protecting him and Homer shows the Gods don’t want the suitors to live.\n The plot= a guy trying to get back to his wife. Courage, determination, fighting thru the odds= traits of Odysseus. The suitors are very arrogant, which is why they don’t be hospitable to the guest, which is really Odysseus in disguise.\n Calypso isn’t a good example of positive hospitality because she doesn’t willing let him leave when he wants to. He lands with the Phaeacian’s and it is a good example of hospitality because he (the king) gives Odysseus every thing he needs to move on. Cyclops is a negative example of good hospitality. He eats all their food, drinks all their wine, and then progresses to eat them. Polyphemus tried to stop them from leaving. Circes isn’t hospitable. She tricks them and turns them into animals. She tricks them but making them stay there for three years. The Sun God is bad hospitality on Odysseus’ men’s’ part because they were greedy with the cows because they could have eaten anything else. A positive example of hospitality- amaeus (swine herder) Odysseus gets whatever he needs and isn’t asked for his name. The best example of negative hospitality is at Odysseus’ palace because Odysseus’ wife and son can’t kick them out and there’s too many of the suitors for the weak people to force out. It’s the law that they have to put up ",this text is about science & mathematics,1,yahootopics,Science & Mathematics,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

Answer: 25 years ago when I was in school we used to feel ashamed to go to a tuition.  Only those who were not intelligent are those who took up tuitions.\n\nNow it is the other way round.  One reason I personally identify for this is the spread of notion that education is  business i.e. commercialisation of education.\n\nSince a number of revenue streams are to be evolved (just like in any business) they created a number of different routes, terms, courses to mint money.\n\nIt is a pity that a student is less (far far less) aware/knowledgeable than a student at the same age (25 years ago)..\n\nIs this development??????????\n\nhttp://www.futureaccountant.com/\nhttp://www.schoolingkids.com/",this text is about family & relationships,1,yahootopics,Family & Relationships,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

"Question: Fains or Fainites: does the word mean anything to you? Schooldays question.

Answer: I'm from London and certainly remember this in my schooldays (60s/70s) though I used to shout ""Fains!"" or ""Fains I!""\n\nSee the following:\n\n"" : 'Feign Knights' is a phrase used by children in Kent, England, UK. I grew up using this phrase as did all my childhood friends. It was used whilst playing tag games and you crossed your fingers saying 'feign knights' and it meant no one could tag you, you were safe, immune from being caught in the game. I now live in Gloucestershire and they do not use this phrase here and have not even heard of it.\n\n: I can certainly confirm that it is used in Kent - I live there (though I am not a native) but I always thought it was spelled 'fainites': I have to confess I am not at all sure about that, as it is not often one sees it written down.\n\n: It was certainly not used where I grew up - my childhood being divided between the Republic of Ireland and schools in Kent and Berkshire.\n\n: Another peculiarly Kentish usage seems to be 'Monkey Peas' for woodlice.\n\n: DFG\n\nThere is an interesting thread on ""faynights"" at rootsweb.com (link below). People from the London area mostly, and some Aussies, recall variations like Faynights, Fanites, Fanelights, Vainites, Venites, etc. The most cogent explanation offered by a poster draws on the Shorter Oxford Dictionary (of which I do not have a copy)which says that the expression is from ""Fains I"" or ""Fains it"". ""Fain"" is taken to be a childhood slang term meaning to claim an exemption from some penalty. \n\nThe SOD apparently says that the etymology of ""fane"" is unknown, so I feel free to speculate that it may be from the archaic English word ""fane"" meaning a temple, shrine or sanctuary.""",this text is about entertainment and music,1,yahootopics,Entertainment & Music,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

"Question: Are homosexuals treated differently in society? If they are treated differently, how so, on what level and in what way? Have you ever experienced this first hand? and have you yourself ever treated a homosexual differently?

Answer: It all depends on where you live. I am gay and live in Provo, Utah, but for the most part I have been treated very well. I often notice that most of the time, people who find out that I am gay tend to be a lot more careful what they say around me so as not to offend me. A lot of people are also very nice once they find out because they also don't want to offend me or hurt my feelings. The only negative situations I have ever encountered were not directed at me personally, but people sometimes have said that they don't agree with homosexuality as a lifestyle but they're always usually pretty quick to add that it doesn't affect how they view me as an individual, which is okay with me. I don't expect everyone to accept my sexuality. My personal motto is that if I expect people to be open-minded toward me, then I should pay them the same respect whether I agree with them or not.

"Question: Does anyone know any REALLY effective workouts for hockey? 

Answer: Jumping Rope\nWorkout Suggestions- change workouts to include jumping with both feet, one foot, and alternating feet. Jump rope 2-4 times per week. Alternate between the following two workouts: \n\n1) Quick Bursts- 30-45 second intervals at the fastest tempo possible without breaking your rhythm, with 1 minute rests between each repetition. Try 3 sets of 3 reps. with a 2 minute rest between each set. \n\n2) Endurance- Jump 20 minutes at a moderated pace, alternating your foot patterns throughout the workout. Set goals of 5, 10, 15, or 20 minutes without a ""miss"". Jump with a walkman on, listening to your stereo, or while watching TV. \n\n\nMuscles Worked- Primary: wrists, ankles, calves. Secondary: shoulders. SOFT FEET. \n\nInline Skating\nYour primary objective should be to reinforce correct skating techniques. Anytime you are in skates, hockey or inline, correct skating motions should be executed. This will develop good habits, not bad ones. Assuming you do this, enjoy a nice sunny day on your blades and remember to ALWAYS wear a helmet and sufficient protective equipment. \n\nWorkout Suggestions- Vary your workouts to include distance training and technical skills training. Train on your inline skates 2-3 times per week. To avoid dehydration and sun burn, skate in the morning or evening and drink plenty of fluids. Select a safe, newly paved surface. \n\n1) Distance Training- skate a 50% speed for 20-30 minutes maintaining a 90 degree kneebend. Try to find a route with changing scenery. \n\n2) Technical Skills Training- Work on your skating and puck control skills for 30-45 minutes. Create drills to develop your forward and backward strides, crossunders, turns, stickhandling, passing, and shooting. This is a mental workout, rather than a physical workout. The emphasis is on precise execution, not power or speed. Skills must be practiced at a learnable rate. Again, for technical skills training ideas and effective drills, call 1-800-320-7545 for our latest hockey skills training video. \n\nMuscles Worked- Quadriceps, hamstrings, cardiovascular. \n\nSlideBoard Training\nA training tool widely used by international speedskaters and competitive hockey players to develop leg strength, correct striding, and to provide a challenging cardiovascular workout. \n\nWorkout Suggestions- Vary your workouts to include distance training, quick burst training, and technical skills training. Incorporate slide board workouts 2-3 times per week. \n\n1) Distance Training- stroke a 50% thrust for 20-30 minutes maintaining a 90 degree kneebend and a consistent head level. Swing your arms back and forth to involve your upper body and to finish the transfer of body weight. Adjust the slide board to a challenging length. \n\n2) Quick Burst Training- Adjust the board to a shorter length. Maintain controlled strides, pick up the tempo of your strides to approximately twice that of your distance training. Three sets of three 30 -45 second bursts at 80-90%. Rest 1 minute between reps and 2 minutes between sets. \n\n3) Technical Skills Training- Complete, explosive leg thrust and upper body control must be maintained throughout any workout involving striding motions. \n\n\nMuscles Worked- Quadriceps, hamstrings, cardiovascular. \n\n\nRunning Steps/Stairs\nThis could very well be one of the best cross-training activities, one that simulates game-like situations, challenges you mentally and physically, and allows you to breathe fresh outside air on a nice summer day. Step training will develop explosive leg strength and quick burst speed. \n\nWorkout Suggestions- Go to your local high school or stadium and run 2-4 sets of 3 reps, 1-2 times per week. Each repetition should involve a 20-30 second burst up the steps, with 45 second rest intervals between each rep. Concentrate on exploding off deep kneebend, swinging arms front to back, and maintaining a level head position.

Answer: There are several programs that are free that can do write movies to DVD RW. Just look up my source and search for DVD burner. I must caution using DVD RW disks and their use as movies. DVD RW is intended to store data that is changing. They make great backup disks and can be erased if the file change is too great. However, over time, DVD RW does loose their ability to store large amounts of data. This is accelerated when the DVD RW is forced to hold almost a full disc and then erased to hold another full disk (The average movie is about 3.8 GB). If you keep re-using A DVD RW just for movies, then you will literally burn out your disc. DVD R is intended to be used on data that is not changing. Like movies for example. I would have to say use a DVD R for movies and use the DVD RW for any data needs. Again, you can use DVD RW for movies but I would not want to waste a DVD RW on just movies.",this text is about computers & internet,0,yahootopics,Computers & Internet,0,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

"Question: How to get off the points for speeding ticket? This is my second speeding ticket since I started driving 10 years ago. I got the first ticket in 2001, but the officer didn't show up to the court, so it got thrown out. Can I still tell this judge  for the second ticket that I have a clean record (even though I got a ticket in 2001)?  Also, I am appeling this because the first time I went to the court, I pledded guilty, instead gulity with reason.  How should I plea this time?  I have already paid $100 as a bail. I don't mind paying this ticket, but i don't want any points on my driving records for insurance purpose. What should I do?

Answer: Go to court and tell them you had a good driving record for about ten years. Maybe they will charge you with unsafe operation of a vehicle which is a higher fine but no points on your license. Whatever you do make sure you go to court and fight your ticket...they might be willing to drop it if you present a good case.",this text is about science & mathematics,1,yahootopics,Science & Mathematics,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

"Question: How can I be a supplier to stores if I can offer merchandise, mainly garments from overseas, at a cheap price? I have contacts with many garments factory owners who are ready to supply big orders at very competetive prices. Can someone tell me how I go about on this to find a buyer in the USA? i live in minneapolis. I will be the middle man in all these and for that do I need to register a business name or what do I have to do? Thanks for the help.

Answer: You're going to want to handle a few things here.  You've got to establish yourself legally as a distributor, which probably involves incorporating or at least setting up an LLC.  (You don't want the personal risk of a shipment going south, do you?)  \n\nSecond, you're going to want to establish distribution fulfillment (how long does it take to get things here, what choices do clients have, what terms are you willing to provide, what kind of shipping insurance, etc. are you putting together to make this a predictable process?)\n\nNext, you're going to want to establish a business presence.  The large retail organization will have buyers: professionals that choose what's going to be in a certain season or promotion's lineup.  You've got to get them the goods, interface with them, and meet their expectations.\n\nI'd recommend one general book for your process: The New Conceptual Selling.  You're going to want to manage client expectations and go through a fact-finding process with them that's going to match their win with your ability to fulfill it.  \n\nI'd also recommend that you meet one or two buyers before investing too much into the business.  You can explain your position and get an actual buyer to teach you at least a few pointers.  Once you get those pointers down, you will be well-enough grounded to actually start the conceptual sales cycle with potential clients.\n\nWhen you're finally to this point, you're going to buy a list of buyers (infousa.com is a reputable source) and prospect them in a regular, cyclical way.  Prospecting Your Way to Sales Success by Bill Good is a great approach to this.  (Kind of a cheesy book, but still the best one I've found out there.)  \n\nThis is probably a very good business for you to get into if you have reliable sources and know what they can safely deliver for you.  Be sure you are delivering what you're selling, and you'll build a business for yourself.\n\nOne alternative approach you can take is to do the same thing with designers (usually out of New York).  These guys are going to drive the biggest retail companies' buy decisions.  For these, you'd position yourself as a direct-factory resource for whatever they're designing.  They'll have exacting standards of quality, materials, textile treatments, delivery times, sizes, etc.  They'd probably be a much more steady source of revenue for you, once you establish yourself with them.\n\nGood luck!",this text is about sports,1,yahootopics,Sports,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20
"Question: What is the g-spot? 

Answer: There is a small mound of tissue just over the eurethra, inside the vagina, which is sensitive to pressure. It has been speculated that this is intended to trigger the final round of contractions when a baby is delivered, because it is exactly where the baby's head presses during final labor. \n\nBut...and perhaps far more useful in the modern world...it also causes those contractions during orgasm, if it has been gently stimulated during sex. \n\nThis causes, in some women, a ""push-out orgasm"", far more intense than a normal one, in which the vagina contracts harder and farther than normal. \n\nThis was first documented by a doctor named Grafenberg, ergo the name ""g-spot"".\n\nHere's a website which covers exactly how to find and stimulate the g-spot, and other advanced sexual techniques, in great detail:",this text is about sports,1,yahootopics,Sports,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20
"Question: Where can I find simple advice and support for what may be an unfair dismissal? I need some help and support here, have no idea about my rights!

Answer: Try http://www.dol.gov for the Department of Labor.\nIf you are representaed by any organized labor (paying member or not), you must work through them before bringing litigation.\nIf you were to try to prove an Unfair Labor Practice occurred, you would need to show that your employer violated a company rule or a law. This is usually very difficult since any potential witnesses are typically other employees and have a lot to lose by testifying against their employer. Also, your company will mount a vigorous defense, so expect them to say awful things about your performance in court. Not a pretty sight.\nIf you don't have any evidence to show another person or official, you might be better off finding a new position. If your company has a Human Resources department, ask them to review the termination; their job is to protect the company from lawsuits and if they smell one coming on, they may work with you to prevent trouble.",this text is about sports,1,yahootopics,Sports,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

"Question: pill description? found pill w/ pliva 430 small round white pill. i dont know what it is?

Answer: Metoclopramide Tablets (10 mg) PLIVA 430  round\nscored white \nGENERIC NAME: metoclopramide\nBRAND NAME: Reglan\nDRUG CLASS: Metoclopramide is a ""prokinetic"" agent that increases muscle tone of the lower esophagus sphincter. The lower esophagus sphincter, located between the esophagus and stomach, normally prevents reflux of acid and other stomach contents into the esophagus. In patients with Gastroesophageal Reflux (GERD), a weakened lower esophagus sphincter allows reflux of stomach acid into the esophagus, causing heart burn and acid damage to the esophagus (peptic esophagitis). Metoclopramide decreases stomach acid reflux by strengthening the lower esophagus sphincter. Like cisapride (Propulsid), metoclopramide also hastens the stomach emptying of solid and liquid meals into the intestines. Rapid emptying of meals also help decrease the reflux of stomach acid and other contents into the esophagus.\n\nMetoclopramide interferes with dopamine receptors in the brain. Since dopamine causes nausea. Metoclopramide can be an effective anti-nausea medication.\n\nWhile cisapride and metoclopramide are similar in decreasing gastroesophageal reflux, metoclopramide is more likely to cause nervous system side effects such as jitteriness, insomnia, sedation, or anxiety. \n\nPRESCRIPTION: no\n\nGENERIC AVAILABLE: yes\n\nPREPARATIONS: tablets: 5 mg and 10mg. Syrup: 5 mg/5 ml \n\nSTORAGE: Tablets and syrup should be stored at temperature between 15-30C \n(59-86F).\n\nPRESCRIBED FOR: Metoclopramide is used on a short term basis (4 to 12 weeks) for patients with heartburn and esophagitis due to gastroesophageal reflux. Please also read the Gastroesophageal Reflux (GERD) article. Stomach nerve damage due to diabetes (diabetic gastric stasis) can cause delayed stomach emptying, resulting in nausea, vomiting, fullness, and heartburn. Metoclopramide can be effective in relieving nausea and other symptoms related to diabetic gastric stasis. Metoclopramide is also used in the treatment of nausea related to postoperative state and cancer chemotherapy.\n\nDOSING: Metoclopramide is usually given four times daily, 30 minutes before each meal and at bedtime for the treatment of esophageal reflux. Dosage and frequency may be lowered in elderly patients, and in situations where symptoms occur only intermittently and at specific times. Concurrent administration of Anticholinergic medications can decrease the effectiveness of metoclopramide.\n\nDRUG INTERACTIONS: Metoclopramide can have nervous system side effects, such as depression, anxiety, sedation, restlessness, and insomnia. Parkinson patients can experience worsening of symptoms with metoclopramide. Metoclopramide may impair the mental and/or physical abilities to drive or operate machinery. Rarely, metoclopramide can cause involuntary muscle movements, facial grimacing, and dystonic reactions resembling tetanus. Since metoclopramide accelerates stomach emptying, it can increase absorption and effects of other medications. For example, the effects of sedatives such as alcohol and diazepam (Valium) can be accelerated when used together with metoclopramide. Safety in pregnancy, nursing mothers, and children has not been established.\n\nSIDE EFFECTS: Metoclopramide is generally well tolerated when used in low doses for brief periods. The nervous system side effects increase with higher doses and longer periods of treatment. The common side effects are mentioned above under Drug Interactions.\n\n\n 1   Glossary   metoclopramide",this text is about politics & government,1,yahootopics,Politics & Government,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

Answer: Well, I can tell you that most people who dismiss things quickly are ignorant. Though every man woman and child is entitled there own opinion, I think that there would be alot more beleivers, if people sat down and did a little research beofre hand. Proof is such a funny word really, and its becasue people asign proof to the word TRUTH, which is not always the case. I beleive that FAITH, is more powerfull and TRUTH or FICTION, as it is a part of ones soul, and is what one must really tap before forming an opinion or beleif. So, in matters of ghost, religion, ect., I simply think that people do not beleive, or research wether or not they beleive is because they lack the proprer balance of Fact, Fiction, and Faith",this text is about computers & internet,1,yahootopics,Computers & Internet,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

"Question: Why do companies on the stock exchange ""buy back"" their own shares sometimes? 

Answer: The fourth answer is the correct answer. A company can not declare profit on their own stocks, even if they buy back at 5 and sell it at $50, not $1 of it will be in income, just additional capital and higher owner's equity. The company itself has no good reason to declare a dividend or a buyback, it helps the share holders only. With less shares outstanding Earnings per share goes up, and that way the company price goes up. It's a way to increase the share price of the company despite no growth, or little growth. Most big companies who have slow growth, but high cash flow make up their slow growth by dividends and buy backs.",this text is about society & culture,1,yahootopics,Society & Culture,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

"Question: which one is false ? let x<0,0<y<1,z>1 which of the following is FALSE ?\n\na)(x^2-z^2) has to be positive\nb)yz can be less than one\nc)xy can never be zero\nd)(y^2-z^2) is always negative\n\nQuestion:\n\nmy question is, should i assume numbers  x,y,z which satisfy those conditions {x<0,0<y<1,z>1} and start testing  each of the answer ?\n\nsay, i took x=-1  , y=.5 , z=2\n\nbut , you know the problem could be, if i choose badly  then everythin would be messed up.\n\nand if i try to solve this problem algebrically, then it would be difficult and time consuming.\n\n\nHow do i solve this problem quickly and correctly ?\ncan you give some tips ?\n\nthank you

Answer: I would try to pull out the inherent properties in the problem as they relate to the possible choices.  For example, in this one, we have:\n\nx < 0\n0 < y < 1\nz > 1\n\nFor (a), we are told that x^2 - z^2 is always negative.  In this case, we want to either note that x^2 - z^2 factors into (x+z)(x-z) or that x^2 = (-x)^2.  Both would suggest that we can make x^2 - z^2 ZERO by choosing any x = -z (e.g. z = 2, x = -2) so (a) is immediately shown FALSE.\n\nFor (b), we note that if z > 1, 0 < 1/z < 1 so that we can let y = 1/z.\n\nFor (c), we simply note that the product of 2 nonzero Real numbers can never be zero.\n\nFor (d), we either note that y^2 - z^2 = (y+z)(y-z) so that we have the product (positive + positive)(smaller # - bigger #) = (positive)(negative) = negative or that squaring a positive number less than 1 will only make the number smaller while squaring a positive number greater than 1 will only make the number bigger so that we get smaller # - bigger # = -#.\n\nTherefore some sort of algebraic analysis is usually the fastest way to attack these problems.  Obviously though, seeing all these tricks takes an understanding and familiarity with algebra.  However, many of the algebraic techniques you need for standardized tests is actually captured in this one problem.\n\nIt'll also help to know when to reverse inequality signs.  For this, understanding increasing/decreasing functions is critical.  For example, if you're subtracting 10 from both sides of an inequality, you look at the graph of y = x - 10 and see that it is strictly increasing (i.e. the larger the values you plug in, the larger the ones you get).  Therefore, in this case, you would not reverse the inequality sign.  If you were multiplying by -2 you would see a strictly decreasing graph and would therefore reverse the inequality sign.\n\nIf you need to guess, plugging in values such as -1, 0, and 1 where appropriate are best for counterexamples.  Also in cases with questions such as above as ""which one is false"", look for answers that appear to be broader in scope.  For example, (c) is pretty narrow.  All it says is that xy cannot obtain one specific value so it is likely to be true.  We can also look at the wording for clues.  (b) uses weak wording: CAN (without the never) is not very restrictive, and in fact, it can be argued on a technicality that (b) is never false.  For example, ""pigs can fly"" is true in an imaginative person's dreams.  (a) and (d) both use strong working, but (a) is broader.  x can assume ANY value less than 0 whereas y must be between 0 and 1, exclusively.  Lastly, look for choices that are equivalent.  If x > 0 and x^2 > 0 are both possibilities, we can eliminate both since they are equivalent conditions. and they can't both be TRUE/FALSE when we are only allowed to pick one or the other.",this text is about business & finance,1,yahootopics,Business & Finance,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

Beta versions still contain all kinds of things that don't work now and will never work later, but Microsoft can't be bothered fixing them because they want to find out if anyone notices first.\n\n2.

I've done almost every variation of curls you can imagine, and some cable lifts too, but are there any lost lifts that I'm missing???

Answer: Pullups/chinups. Not only does it work the biceps, but also your lats and shoulders. A lot of back exercises work the biceps too. Barbell or dumbbell rows, cable rows, lat pulldowns will all work your biceps. And squats. It may sound strange, but squats are great for a full body workout. Your body releases a ton of growth hormones just from squats alone, that all your muscles benefit.\n\nAnd don't forget to work your triceps too. They do make up 2/3 of your upper arm, and having well shaped tri's can really make your arms look great!\n\nThe link below is an article called ""How Can A Bodybuilder Add Inches To The Arms In The Shortest Time?""

"Question: i just want a chemistry lab report? 

Answer: for a sample lab report see this link: http://faculty.coloradomtn.edu/jeschofnig/class/class_jeschof/ch2-srp1.htm\n\n\nif you mean ""how to write a Chemistry lab report ?"" here are the steps:\n\nUse the following design when writing formal lab reports. Although many lab reports will not be formal ones, you are expected to know the details of this design and to understand the logical sequence of ideas within it. \nTitle A concise statement of the problem \nIntroduction Optional in chemistry and physics; generally required in biology: A statement of objectives or a hypothesis may be necessary if the TITLE does not fully describe the problem being studied. The hypothesis is what you think will happen during the investigation. It differs from a guess in that it is based upon prior knowledge or evidence. It should be supported by previously developed evidence and/or concepts. \nMaterials Lists of materials used are generally required in our biology experiments. In chemistry and physics, include this section only if you have actively taken part in the design of the experiment and the selection of materials.  \nProcedure Write a procedure only if you have actively taken part in the process of designing the experiment, otherwise state the source of the procedure. Explain, with diagrams, what you did in order to collect the DATA. You should understand and be able to apply the principles involved in running a controlled experiment. You are encouraged to identify the assumptions upon which the experiment is based. \nQuantitative Data Evidence collected during the experiment; numbers read directly from laboratory instruments (clocks, rulers, balances, etc., but not calculators). Data should be well organized and tabulated when possible. Use care in scale reading and use significant figures when taking measurements. Develop a sense of how much data is desirable. Understand the need for carrying out multiple experiments and strive to get reproducible data when practical. Do not hide or eliminate suspected faulty data but present it. Later, in your CONCLUSIONS, you may explain why you have decided not to use suspected errors in your analysis. \nQualitative Data Other forms of evidence, qualitative in nature, that may be useful in the interpretation of QUANTITATIVE DATA; for example, something unexpected that happened during the carrying out of the PROCEDURE that may affect your CONCLUSIONS. In qualitative experiments which are frequently carried out in biology, these observations may be the only form of evidence collected. Then a RESULTS section may be unnecessary, and CONCLUSIONS will be based upon the QUALITATIVE DATA. \nCalculations Use illustrations (sample problems) to show how you converted DATA into RESULTS. You are encouraged to use calculators and computers. Computer programs or spreadsheets used in the analysis should appear in this section. Use significant figures in calculations involving measurements. Use units as well as numbers in all calculations. Use dimensional analysis to accomplish this. Write equations of any straight lines from graphs of experimental DATA or RESULTS. \nResults The final form in which the evidence is prepared. You perform CALCULATIONS on the DATA in order to develop RESULTS. Your CONCLUSIONS should be understandable by looking at your RESULTS. Tabulate results of primary variables in a meaningful order. Graph variables to detect general trends. When possible (if y=mx+b), supply equations of these graphs. Understand the gain in information and usefulness when results are converted into systematic tables, graphs, and finally equations.  \nConclusions Contain the answers to the problem stated in the TITLE and INTRODUCTION. Base your conclusions on your RESULTS, not despite them. Look for more than one conclusion to the problem, with suggestions for further work in order to differentiate these at a later date. It is not necessary to do the further work. Understand that conclusions from one experimen",this text is about family & relationships,1,yahootopics,Family & Relationships,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

"Question: My laptop will not power on.  What is happening? I was using my laptop last night and it suddenly turned off.  I tried powering on using just the battery and nothing happend.  I tried powering on using just the power supply/charger and it still won't turn on.  I really need the information/files off the hard drive for my husband's business!  Help!!! What should I do/try next?

Answer: It could be a few things:\n\n1. See if it is a loose power connection on the laptop. Wiggle the power connector where it enters the laptop and watch the power light. If it blinks, there's the issue. Find a spot where you can hold it as you use it.\n\n2. Bad Battery, you tried with just the power cord so unlikely. Remove the battery aand try again.\n\n3. Bad power supply. I've seen plenty that had been chewed by pets. Look it over and try the power light test again.\n\nThe other thing to consider is getting you data off for business reasons. Can't spend all day trying to get the laptop to work now do ya?  Run over to Comp USA and buy a 2.5"" external drive kit.  It will enable you to remove the hard drive from the laptop and place it in the external bay. You then plug a USB wire into the device and any XP PC.

"Question: (about JAVA)A small question on this small piece of code...? In the code written here:\nhttp://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java:Swing\nhow can I call a function when there is a mouse press/release for a button

Answer: The code on wikibooks actually calls System.exit(0) when the exit button is pressed.\nThe code segment is below\n\n        //Creates a button on the calculator that can be used to close the program\n        JButton buttonExit = new JButton(""Exit"");\n//Creates a keyboard shortcut of Alt+C to use to close the program //instead of having to click on the button\n        buttonExit.setMnemonic(KeyEvent.VK_C);\n        buttonExit.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {\n                public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {\n                System.exit(0); \n                }\n        });\n        //adds the Exit button\n        panel.add(buttonExit);\n\nThere are two ways of doing what you would like.\nFirstly, you could copy the 'buttonExit.addActionListener(..); part to every other button and make the function actionPerformed in the new ActionListener do what you would like.  For instance, you could get it to write to the console with a line like\nSystem.out.println(""You pressed the button xx"");\ndepending on which button was pressed.\n\nSecondly, you could create a seperate ActionListener and implement in the actionPerformed method checks to see which button was pressed.  Note, this would need to be a seperate class.  For instance\nclass FullActionListener // the action listener for all buttons\npublic void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {\n    String command = e.getActionCommand();\n    if (command.equals(""9"")) {\n        // do whatever you need to here for the button 9.\n        System.out.println(""You pressed button 9"");\n    } else if (command.equals(""8"")) {\n        // etc\n    }\n}\n\nThen,\nActionListener al = new FullActionListener();\n// the code on wikibooks\n        //creates all of the numbers that would be seen on a calculator\n        JButton button1 = new JButton(""1"");\n        button1.addActionListener(al);\n        panel.add(button1);\n        JButton button2 = new JButton(""2"");\n        button2.addActionListener(al);\n        panel.add(button2);\n etc...",this text is about science & mathematics,1,yahootopics,Science & Mathematics,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

"Question: Internet, computer, possible ventrilo problems, I don't know? Since yesterday, I've been randomly getting kicked off WOW, when I play. I believe it's due to ventrilo, but no one I know, seems to know how to fix it. When I get kicked off, not only do I get kicked off WOW, but I lose all connectivity with the internet as well. I have to then restart my computer and everything is back up again. Why is this doing this. I've check for upgrades, and redownloaded ventrilo, nothing seems to work? Could someone please clue me in with what's going on?

Answer: Are you on dialup?\n\nIf you are on dialup, you cannot connect to any Ventrilo server unless it is set to ultra low quality. MOST servers are not set to low quality.\n\nYou will lose connection to Vent, Wow maybe even entire internet if Vent is trying to use more bandwith than you currently have on your connection.\n\nDoes this help?\n\nAlso as the source below suggests, you may be behind some sort of Firewall or router preventing packets or data flow.\n\nLastly (and in very rare cases) your internet provider may have certain ports or routing tables blocked to prevent specific internet activities from happening. I know a friend who was unable to play Battlefield 2 or WoW because her ISP had ports blocked preventing game play.\n\nTo check for lost packets run a trace route. This will test to see if you are losing data due to either your ISP or the game itself.\n\nIn Windows XP \n\n1. Go to Start\n2. Go to Run\n3. Type ""cmd"" (no quotes)\n4. Type ""tracert <server name>""\n\ni.e. If the IP of the WOW server is 23.121.33.118, you will type \n""tracert 23.121.33.118""\n\nTo get the IP information of the WoW server you play on, please consult World Of Warcraft Official Website or contact a staff member of WoW. I neither play wow, nor have any information on its server details.\n\nThis should get the ball rolling. Does it help? let me know",this text is about sports,1,yahootopics,Sports,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

Answer: Marriages end because people become selfish and do not care about working as a team with their spouse.  They also can be shallow and fall out of love with their spouse's physical appearance because they are full of their own desires and don't care about the other person's feelings at all.  \nA guy like this is not worth your time.

Answer: yes, the blood type is based on the genes of the parents, so there are 2 parts. being positive is a dominant trait and being negative is recessive.  so the you also have to look at the grandparents.  if one of them had both recessive genes and the other had postive, that would mean that one of the parents could have passed on the recessive gene and the other a dominant making that person be positive, but still able to pass on the recessive gene.",this text is about computers & internet,1,yahootopics,Computers & Internet,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

It is sore if I am chewing and it is AGONY if I eat anything sweet.\n\nWhat can I do to stop it hurting until I get a filling in it? My mum told me to take some ibuprofen but it hasn't helped. I'm 15 by the way.

Answer: I'm sorry you're in pain sweetie. You could take some paracetamol as well to try to help ease the pain, and you could try rinsing your mouth with a hot salt water rinse, that sometimes helps me when I get toothache. Avoid anything that makes it worse, so don't eat anything sweet, and make sure you keep the cavity clean - rinse it out after every time you eat. If it gets worse, you should probably call the dentist to see if he can fit you in any sooner.

"Question: If this die is rolled once, what is the probability that the outcome will be a 2 or a 4? A die is loaded so that it is equally likely to roll a 1 or a 2.  Rolling a 3 or a 4 is also equally likely, and each of these is twice as likely as rolling a 1.  Finally, rolling a 5 or a 6 is equally likely and each of these is 3 times as likely as rolling a 3.\n\na.  1/6\nb.  1/4\nc.  5/12\nd.  7/18\ne.  none of the others

Answer: Think of the die as containing one 1, one 2, two 3s, two 4s, six 5s, and six 6s.\n\nThis way, the probability of rolling a 3 is 2/18 = 1/9 and the probability of rolling a 5 is 6/18 = 1/3, which is three times as likely as 1/9.\n\nNow, since there is only one 2 present on the die, the chance of rolling a two is 1/18. Since there are two 4s on the die, the chance of rolling a 4 is 2/18. Add these two probabilities together to get:\n1/18 + 2/18 = 3/18 = 1/6\n\nThe answer is (a) 1/6\n\nGood luck, I hope this helps!",this text is about computers & internet,1,yahootopics,Computers & Internet,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

It's really a pain in the arse, which was why I always recommend having a networked printer when you have two or more PC's.

"Question: Where do you think JJ Redick and Sheldon Williams will go in the NBA draft? Results of mock drafts have them going 14th and 12th respectively. I think they will both be lottery picks. I could see Sheldon going higher than JJ, just because the bottom teams need a good physical inside player and Sheldon fits the bill.

Answer: I saw a report somewhere recently that Duke has most number of NBA players currently active compared to other schools, which pleased me, but was surprising.  I didn't know Shavlick Randolph was on the 76'ers roster, cool.  Anyway, the media would have people believe that NBA GMs will be high on Sheldon Williams based on the recent success of other Duke big man alums in Carlos Boozer and Elton Brand.  Personally I think the Landlord (Williams) merits considerable consideration for his accomplishment over his college career including multiple defensive player of the year accolades as well as being only the 3rd collegiate player to amass so many rebounds, points, and blocked shots in a season.  I think Williams' accomplishments on the court get overlooked because of all the attention on Reddick.\n\nAll that said, Sheldon Williams should be a definite lottery pick.  I really wouldn't be too surpised if Portland (the worse team in the NBA) had the #1 pick and took Williams.  But then again I could understand Portland taking local, collegiate All-American Adam Morrison for both the player and the fan support.\n\nSo I'll go with the Hawks at #4 (based on present overall standings) overall taking the Landlord.  The Hawks have their backcourt set fairly well, but they need a strong prescence inside and Williams should make an instant contribution, potentially starting from the 1st day.\n\nJ.J. Reddick is a bit more difficult to project in terms of figuring out what NBA GMs might think about him.  On one hand if you believe the media then Reddick is going to fall to around the 20th slot.  I wonder when the last time the College Player of the Year fell out of the lottery.  I've heard critics say Reddick can't create his shot, he's too slow, he can't play defense, he's one dimensional, all to which I say is bogus.  Reddick is extremely talented with near unlimited range, a player in the mold of Reggie Miller or Ray Allen.  In the present NBA where jump shooters are in the minority, whomever drafts Reddick will be getting a steal.\n\nThat all said, looking over the draft board, it would make the most sense for the Charolette Bobcats to take Reddick at #3 overall.  The Bobcats are presently lacking outside scoring, as well as someone that can run with ex-Tarheel Raymond Felton.  How scary fun would the Bobcats be at least from a publicity draw to feature a roster of some of the best Duke and UNC alums...?

Answer: Hi!\nI  don't know what style of christian music your friends like, but here are some options-\nIf they like rock try: RED - End of Silence, It is really, really good.\nor you could try Skillet - Comatose, it's also good. Plumb - Chaotic Resolve, this was the best c.d. that came out this year! BarlowGirl - Another Journal Entry, not as good as their self-titled c.d. but still good. Sarah Brendel - (Self-Titled) She has a rather thick German accent, but it's worth listening to.\n\nIf they like Pop try: Krystal Meyers - Dying for a Heart, she sounds a little bit like Hillary Duff, but better. Natalie Grant - Awaken, this c.d. has a mix of all styles, but mostly pop. Nichloe Nordeman - Brave, this is a softer side of pop, but I love it. Jars of Clay - Good Monsters, this C.D. was rated c.d. of the year by CCM magazine. Rebecca St. James - If I Had One Chance to Tell You Something, she is more rocky that pop, but really good. Ana Laura - (Self-Titled) Softer pop, good.\n\nIf they like softer stuff try: Leigh Nash - Blue on Blue, she was the lead singer in Sixpence None the Richer. Michael W. Smith - Stand, I haven't heard this C.D. but, if you like Michael, you'll probably like this!\n\nIf they want Christmas music try - (Most of these C.D.'s are older,)Jump 5 - All the Joy in the World, classic bubble-gum music. Point of Grace - A Christmas Story or their new one - Winter Wonderland. Stacie Orrico - Christmas Wish, this is an E.P. with only 6 songs, but it's worth it. Natalie Grant - Believe, this is more of a Gospel type with strong vocals. Leigh Nash also just released a new Electronic E.P. that I think you can get at iTunes. Rebecca St. James - Christmas, a mix of traditional songs.\n\nThere, I hope this gives you some ideas!",this text is about science & mathematics,1,yahootopics,Science & Mathematics,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

Others include things like migraines, cluster headaches, and they are also a common feature in many other illnesses like the flu or other generalized infections. They may come from muscular sources, vascular sources (in the blood vessels of the head or brain), or--RARELY--from increased pressure inside the head from something like a brain tumor or fluid mechanics problem.

"Question: who and what did lonnie g.johnson? 

Answer: For years, Lonnie G. Johnson has been inventing thermodynamics systems for NASA and other organizations; but he has won his greatest fame for re-inventing the squirt gun.\n\nJohnson capped a childhood of tinkering with appliances in his senior year of high school, when he won a national inventing competition for ""Linex,"" a remote-control robot he had built out of junkyard scraps. He went on to more formal training at Tuskegee University, where he earned first a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering (1972) and then an M.S. in Nuclear Engineering (1974). \n\nSoon thereafter, Johnson joined the U.S. Air Force, where he became an Advanced Space Systems Requirements Officer at the headquarters of the Strategic Air Command in Omaha, Nebraska. After directing many projects and earning several decorations, as well as a Nomination for Astronaut Training, Johnson moved on to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. Here he helped develop thermodynamic and controls systems for space projects, including award-winning work for the Galileo Jupiter probe and the Mars Observer project; his crowning achievement at JPL was the Johnson Tube, a CFC-free refrigeration system with a hydraulic heat pump, which later earned Johnson his seventh patent (#4,724,683; 1988). \n\nWhile with the USAF and JPL, Johnson continued to invent at home. In 1985, he founded his own company, later renamed Johnson Research and Development.. Johnson had first conceived his most famous invention in 1982: when a homemade nozzle at his bathroom sink shot a spray of water across the room, Johnson resolved to invent the world's first high-performance, pressurized water gun. \n\nJohnson with partner Bruce D'Andrade finally created a workable prototype of the now famous SuperSoaker® in 1989. They filed for a joint patent (granted 1991) and found a manufacturer, Larami Corp. (now a subsidiary of Hasbro, Inc.). The SuperSoaker® uses an air pump to pressurize its water supply, allowing for tremendous distance and accuracy in water-marksmanship. Those unfamiliar with this product cannot appreciate its popularity: since 1990, over 40 million SuperSoakers® have generated over $200 million in sales; today, dozens of websites are devoted to them. \n\nMeanwhile, Johnson has earned over 40 patents, and continues to invent in the realms of thermo- and fluid dynamics as well as toys. In addition to ongoing controls work for NASA, Johnson and his company are developing an improved home radon detector, a rechargeable battery, and a heat pump that uses water instead of freon, among other projects. \n\nLonnie Johnson has won numerous honors for his success in inventing and entrepreneurship, and his constant encouragement of young people to invent. He is a legendary businessman and public figure in his hometown of Marietta, Georgia---whose Mayor declared February 25, 1994 ""Lonnie G. Johnson Day"" in his honor---and, thanks to the SuperSoaker®, he is a hero to kids nationwide.",this text is about education and reference,0,yahootopics,Education & Reference,0,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

"Question: determine the geometrical figure? what will be the geometrical figure of 3 ^ (5) = 122 ^ (2) - 121 ^ (2)\nlike 3 ^ (2) = 5 ^ (2) - 3 ^(2) satisfies the conditions of making a right triangle.similarly any given number with any given power can be expressed as difference of infinite sets of two perfect squares\nand the squares can be terminating decimals what will be the geometrical figures of such a case?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6

Answer: You mean 3^2 = 5^2 - 4^2 ... dimensionally this works.  For examples, if the units are feet, then you can take a bunch of one foot by one foot ceramic floor tiles, and arrange them in a 5 by 5 square, then take away a 4 by 4 square chunk of that, and rearrange what remains into a 3 by 3 square of tiles.  Translated into inches, you get (3*12)^2 = (5*12)^2 - (4*12)^2: if you have a whole lot of one inch by one inch tiles, and you make a big 60 by 60 square out of then and remove a 48 by 48 subsquare, then you can rearraqnge the remaining little tiles into a 36 by 36 square.\n\nNow consider 3^5 = 243 = (122 + 121)*(122 - 121) = 122^ - 121^2, again in feet.  When you translate that into inches, it doesn't scale the same way: the left hand side is multiplied by 12^5 but the right hand side is only multiplied by 12^2.  What kind of geometrical figure do you want to use given that it does not scale?  ""Take a bunch of little one by one by one by one by one foot hypercubes, and arrange them in five space ... then when you project along the ... the result looks like ..."" ??? ""... but subdivide each hypercube into 12^5 little one inch by ... hypercubes and what you just did no longer works"".

"Question: I need to print an image on two 8 x 11 sheets of paper. I need the image to ""split"". Any idea how to do this? I have an image that is 8 x 11 in size. I want to create an image that is I suppose 16 x 22 in size, but I need to do it on two different sheets of paper. I am putting this image on a cake and the edible ink printer can only print 8 x 11 sheets. i thought if I put two together, I can make the image bigger - but I'm not sure how to ""split"" the image up so that it will print out on two different sheets of 8 x 11 paper. Any ideas?

Answer: Use Adobe Photo Shop, Print Shop Plus, or Paint. Paint is located under Programs&#92;Accessories, or any other software you might have. Create 2 file folders in the program you chose. Copy the 'full' image into each folder. Open the first folder, determine your 'exact' center-line and erase 1/2 half of the image. Click file and save. Open the other folder, erase the 'other' half of the image and save. Open the first folder, and do your print command. This will print the first half of the image. Open the other folder and again do the print command. This will give you prints of the total image on 2 sheets.",this text is about society & culture,1,yahootopics,Society & Culture,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20
"Question: why is the globe tilt on its axis,is there any effect on humanity if it is not tilted? 

Answer: Globes are tilted -- the angle is about 23.5 degrees -- because that is the angle between the axis of rotation of the Earth and the normal of the Ecliptic. The Ecliptic is the orbital plane of the Solar System.\n\nThe tilt is responsible for the seasons. If the angle was zero degrees, the Sun would always travel the same apparent path through the sky (over the equator, of course) and there would be no seasons. The reason the seasons change is in summer, the pole of the Earth is tilted toward the Sun and more light falls on that hemisphere, warming it up. On the opposite hemisphere, pointed more away from the sun, less light falls and it's colder. Since the tilt of the axis remains more or less constant, the seasons change as the Earth orbits the sun, warming up opposite hemispheres alternately.",this text is about business & finance,1,yahootopics,Business & Finance,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20
"Question: How would you rate Cooley Law Scool in Lansing, Michigan?  How tough is it to succeed at this school? 

Answer: Overall, I think Cooley is a good law school.  The obvious draw back is that it doesn't have much national recognition or prestige, which translates to difficulty in obtaining certain types of legal employment (by which I mean the kinds of jobs that pay good salaries).  This is pretty easy to see if you compare the average starting salary of a Cooley grad to those of schools in other tiers.  \n\nThat said, I think the quality of education you can get at Cooley is on par with any law school in the country.  While they don't have the big name professors at the fore front of their fields, I found all of the professors I had to be very capable educators, and truly concerned with helping us to understand the law.\n\nIt is difficult to say how tough it is to succeed at Cooley.  I worked very hard, got a 4.0 my first semester, a 3.9 my second semester (15 hours each semester) and transferred to an Ivy League law school.  In my mind, anything less wouldn't have been successful, but other people were thrilled to have above a B average.\n\nOne thing that is certainly true at Cooley is that there isn't any grade inflation.  While an average GPA at top schools might be 3.4, I calculated the average GPA in my section at Cooley to be around 2.2 - more than a full point lower.  But that is a little misleading, too.  While the curve is lower, due to the admission requirements, there are also a lot more people at Cooley that in all honesty aren't competing for the top grades.\n\nIn sum, I would say that purely from an educational standpoint, Cooley is a great school.  When it comes to getting a job, especially in medium to large law firms, Cooley is subpar.  If that is your (husband's) goal, it is very important to work harder than he thinks he needs to, and get the very best grades, and transfer to the highest ranked school possible.  It's sad that it has to be that way, but it is.\n\nGood Luck!",this text is about society & culture,1,yahootopics,Society & Culture,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

Answer: You seem to have a combination of unassociated problems.

"Question: what is safest way to get rid of an old computer,which may have personal information on it? 

Answer: The only place where there is information that you have stored on the computer is on the Hard Drive.  Open your computer's case. You will see a ribbon cable that goes from the motherboard to the floppy drive (if you have one) and a cable that goes to the Hard Drive which might also go to a CD drive, etc.\n\nFollow the ribbon cable to the hard drive. It should have just a power cable and a ribbon cable going to it.  It is usually about an inch tall, maybe 3-4 inches wide, and 5-6 inches long. You will probably need a phillips screwdriver to remove this. Remove the cables as well. When you have it out, that is the only thing you will have to destroy.

"Question: When will Republicans publicly apologize for electing George W. Bush? 

Answer: President Bush was quite successful actually at accomplishing many of the aims of his party:  1. passage of legislation ""necessitated"" by the events of September 11th that empowered his administration and future administrations to monitor the actions of its citizens more carefully than ever before (ie - Patriot Act), 2. firm support of many of the conservative ideals of the ""conservative side"" of his party - halting progress in stem cell research, support for instruction of intelligent design within schools, defense of marriage as an institution reserved for heterosexuals (by way of constitutional amendment!), etc, et cetera, et cetera.  3. Continued exploitation of foreign economies through legislation such as CAFTA, hypocritical stance on illegal immigration that ostensibly suggests that his administration is against it when, in reality, they couldn't be more for it - that which injects much cheap, productive labor into the economy, 4. That whole war on terror / war on oil debate isn't really a debate is it.  So long as the US is able to continue its penetration into new foreign markets, wrest control over other nations' resources, our economy may continue growing.

Answer: There is such a thing as a matrix plot, which is a way to display all possible two-way scatter plots (in this case, it's 5!/(2!3!) = 10 different scatter plots).  I posted a link below to see what a matrix plot looks like.\n\nOf course you really can't see a normal distribution on a scatter plot.  If you add up the students exams or take the mean, you can draw a histogram of the data to get an idea what the distribution looks like.  It's possible that they are normally distributed, but it depends on the exams and the skill level of the class.  If one exam is easy, then its distribution would be skewed to the left (meaning it has a left tail), which would not be normal-looking.  Same thing with hard exams except those would be skewed to the right.

"Question: What is a good resource for learning Japanese? I work for a japanese co. and would like to have a functional understanding of the language (with in reason obviously this is a difficult language to just ""pick Up"") any tips?

Answer: Living Language has a CD-based course that is exceptional for many languages including Japanese. I think there are 8 Cd's. I highly recommend it. It is by far better to learn a language through your ears than through your eyes! Listen to the CD's over and over again and the nuances of pronunciation and cadence (the rhythm of the language which is important in Japanese) - look up ""Mora"" or ""Japanese Mora timing"". I recommend listening to all of the Cd's at least 3 times each while driving or something before even beginning to study them. You will be amazed how much easier it is that way. First time through play and don't even try to listen. Second time listen only with light attention. Third time pay close attention. Fourth time through start repeating whatever you want to and try to be precise in all ways -tone, pitch, cadence, pronunciation, enunciation etc.  Good luck!",this text is about science & mathematics,1,yahootopics,Science & Mathematics,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

"Question: How can a will be contested by a lw's or a gp's family after she or he had just expressly notified in writing ... ...that she or he wants to leave all her or his property, money, and assets to his or her partner or spouse after the lw or gp dies? How can the family of the lw or gp win the right to gain all of the the lw's or gp's belongings? What is said during trials to persuade the judge to hand everything over the family?\n\nlw = lesbianwoman\ngp= gayperson

Answer: I do not have the specific legal information to answer this question but there are several legal links online:\n\n\nTo get what you want, write it into your Will. Aside from distributing your estate, your Will should specify what funeral arrangements you want — in any degree of detail. It should also name a personal representative (perhaps your partner) to carry out your wishes.\n\nAnother document that will help your partner in the event of your death is a Relationship (or Partnership) Agreement, identifying the possessions in your household that belong to each of you. This will help assure that her or his property is not improperly involved in the settlement of your estate.\n\nRather than relying solely on a Will to communicate your funeral instructions, you may prefer to choose a funeral home and select — even pre-pay — your desired arrangements in advance. Prepayment plans often entail price protection and installment plans. If you make plans with a funeral home, just make sure your partner and relatives know that you have done so. Also, describe the arrangement in your Will.\n\nhttp://www.gaylesbianretiring.org/legal.htm\n\nhttp://www.rainbowlaw.com/\n\nFor legal documents: http://www.rainbowlaw.com/legal_documents.htm\n\nhttp://www.legalaid.wa.gov.au/InfoAboutLaw/aspx/default.aspx?Page=Family/GayLesbian.xml\n\nhttp://www.nolo.com/resource.cfm/catID/F896EE61-B80C-4FE1-B1687AC0F07903BA/118/304/\n\nhttp://www.nolo.com/product.cfm/ObjectID/65E7D52B-E9E5-435F-A51F24A3045B2369/118/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttp://www.buddybuddy.com/partners.html",this text is about science & mathematics,1,yahootopics,Science & Mathematics,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

Pitching has not been as good as advertised. I just dont trust Burnett, and Towers I think the league has figured him out.

"Question: Why every object on earth in rest condition? do not say it is due gravitation? see details.? According gravitation, force between two masses m1 and m2 is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them and directly proportional to the product of their masses. But, mass of any object is negligible with respect to the mass of earth. Think over it!

Answer: Hello Friend! \n       Let us see a small example. If we are in a moving bus, the trees on the road side appear to be moving fastly in the opposite direction. Even though that the trees are at rest, they appear to move. This is due to the special  theory of relativity. \n       Even though that the earth is rotating with large velocity, the objects stay on the earth.

"Question: What are the general products in a reaction between a strong acid and an alcohol funtional group? 

Answer: Because strong acids are terrible bases (by definition), conjugate base will never deprotonate the alcohol.  However, because there is an electrophile in solution now (hydrogen ions) and lone pairs on the oxygen in the alcohol (nucleophile) the hydroxyl group (alcohol part) can be protonated to make a great leaving group---water.  Now you have a carbocation that will rapidly react with any close nucleophile in solution, or, more likely, it will form a double bond with another carbon and eliminate another hydrogen in the process.  This is most likely at high temperatures (>150C) and with near-concentrated acid.  Otherwise, there will simply be an equilibrium of the protonated alcohol leaving, and then an oxygen coming back.  \n\nThe reaction you are most likely (and most useful) looking for is an acid-catalyzed dehydration (E1) reaction.",this text is about computers & internet,1,yahootopics,Computers & Internet,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

Answer: The difference is that the catechism of the catholic church teaches love and respect for all people. You have to remember that extremists make all people look bad. Think of Islam. Anyway, you have to take things in context. Look at the fundamental teachings of christ. Read the New Testament, it will be good for you. All religions follow those fundamental teachings, and the only reason for the crusades, and all of those other things you mentioned, was that some extremist's power went to his head and he decided to start making rules.

"Question: we are having a find raiser and we don't know what to raffle off? 

Answer: So you want to raise funds for your group by having a raffle. Here are some questions that you probably should ask yourself:\n\n - How much money do you want to raise?\n - How much money do you want to spend to raise the amount in the first question?\n - Who will be likely to buy raffle tickets?\n -  How many raffle tickets do we expect to sell?\n\nMany local businesses might be willing to donate merchandise or services as prizes for your raffle in exchange for some advertising. If you are thinking of having lots of small to medium prizes, check with your local Starbucks - they often will give out gift cards for groups as raffle prizes. Also check with smoothie places. For nicer prizes, perhaps companies can donate items for gift baskets - like movie tickets or spa coupons or fancy snacks or gift cards to different local stores. For really high-end prizes, check with car dealerships for cars or travel agents for travel packages.\n\nOnce you have a grand prize or set of prizes, you can price the tickets - perhaps $1 for a chance to win something in the $10-$50 range or upwards of $25 for a chance to win a trip or a car. If you are selling $1 tickets, you can probably get by with just having a cashbox at a booth and a roll of tickets, and just have ""must be present when the number is announced to win"". but for high end prizes, you should probably be able to accept checks, make special custom tickets, and get full contact information for ticket buyers, to let them know if they win.\n\nLocal businesses love to say that they give back to the community, and one way they do that is to donate stuff for community and school groups that raffle off the the stuff for fundraisers. So check with your local businesses - perhaps you might be raffling movie tickets or gift cards for the mall or an iPod or a weekend trip for two to a local resort. make sure you raffle off something that people want. if people aren't interested in your prize, they might not be willing to buy a ticket.\n\ngood luck!",this text is about science & mathematics,1,yahootopics,Science & Mathematics,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

A nice environment to work as an artist, answer seriously and compassionately. I'd appreciate it, thanks a bunch...happy new year

Answer: Seattle is NOT an option if finances are an issue...rent is higher than in San Francisco, insurance premiums and auto registration are very high and the property, income and sales taxes are outrageous... Have you contemplated Oregon? Grants Pass, Medford and Eugene all meet the criteria of ""another friendly, laidback, artsy city not too expensive""\nAdd to that the beautiful climate and utterly stunning scenery....Property and income taxes are on the high side but Oregon does not have sales tax, so it balances out, auto registration is a bit lower than in Cali, and no smog certs required....socially, Oregon is very diverse, so whatever your politics and interests, you'll be able to find like minded folks.",this text is about computers & internet,1,yahootopics,Computers & Internet,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

Answer: If all were in their primes, I would say Flair. Remember, Terry Funk in his prime was not the Terry Funk we see now. He was NWA champ for 2 years and fought some tough matches, but nowhere near the the ""hardcore"" matches we see him in now. Also his skills with the mic were not as strong as they are now, so a booker would most likely not give him a title vs. Flair to be the standard bearer for a promotion.

"Question: senior paper on conformity in fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury.  Help? 

Answer: I would guess you are asking how the book shows conformity. To that I would have to point out that in the book there is little to no reading material. The people only see art through their television which is run by the government. Without seeing any creativity through either written form or other artistic outlets, a person would not have any thoughts against their given reality. \n\nThe book runs along the same lines as the movie 1984 which also has the theme of destroying all manner of creativity and controlling the population through created and fabricated information. \n\nThe book does show though that even though people can be fed false information, eventualy (in the case of the main character) they will reject their created reality and will go off in search of the truth. Much the same happend in the movie 1984 and other similar big brother style movies and books. Even the popular movie The Matrix has similar ties in that people are forced into a fabricated reality and over time many come to believe something is wrong with their existance and question what is real and what is not.",this text is about politics & government,1,yahootopics,Politics & Government,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20
"Question: I am interested in being a dental hygienist or dental assistant? I am interested in persuing a career in the dental industry. Is there any dental hygienists or assistants out there who can tell me how long would I have to go to school for each one, and how difficult it would be. It's a big deal for me because I'm 40 and this is a whole new thing for me.

Answer: Dental Hygienist:    There are 2 different program types to become a hygienist.  There is the associate's degree program and the bachelor's degree program.  To obtain your associate's degree in hygiene it takes approximately 2 1/2 - 3 years.... 2 years of hygiene school plus a semester or two to take pre-requisite classes.  To obtain your bachelor's degree in hygiene takes 4 years.  Once graduated from your hygiene program, you will be required to take an exam administered by your State Board of Dental Examiners that you must pass in order to receive your license to practice in your state.\n\nDental Assistant:    Dental assisting programs vary greatly.  They could range from about 7 months to 2 or 3 semesters.  Generally only a technical certificate is obtained to become a dental assistant.  Also, depending on the state you live in, the functions of a dental assistant vary.  Assistants are allowed to do certain things in some states that they aren't allowed to do in other states.... for one example.. packing a cord during a crown prep procedure.  There are Certified Dental Assistants and Expanded Duty Dental Assistants... tests are given once finished with schooling for both the CDA and the EDA.  An assistant is required to hold a radiology license within the state they are working in order to be able to take x-rays.",this text is about politics & government,1,yahootopics,Politics & Government,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20
"Question: Women, help me please!? This might be the toughest decision i have to make.  I was date raped 12 weeks ago, and got pregnant by the mother******. He left the country right after, so i decided to have an abortion.  I live in a very conservative area, and decided to go for the Cytotec abortion. Took 12 pills and inserted 6, bleeded 15 days, and come to find out today that the fetus is still alive.  It already has a heartbeat, and i don't want to abort it now because of that, but i live in fear that it will have birth defects related to the pills i took. Please help me clear my mind, i won't read any idiotic insults, as i realize what i did, nor will i pay attention to condemnig me, but what can i do now?

Answer: I was raped by my x.  He got 8 months in jail while i recieved the rest of my life with the most beautiful girl.  I tried abortion and was unable to finish it.  \nTake this as a sign from God that there is a reason for this child.  If you are unable to keep it than yes adopt the child out. \nThe child you carry could very well save the world from cancer, come up with the next treatment for sever retardation in children, or invent the most increadible machine ever. \n\nWhat we choose to do makes a differance in the future.  This has happened for a reason.  Go see a doctor, take prenatal vitamans take care of yourself and this baby.  The child living through the abortion pills and inseres makes me believe that this child is wanting to live.  That should have been enough signs but if you are anything like myself I was takingin home preg tests up till 2 weeks before my daughter was born.  I though it would go away.  \nI laugh at this now 12 years later.  I know you are scared and worrid about what this child may turn out like, but believe me if i  have learned nothing in the last 13 years it is that God has a plan.  I may not know what it is but I do know that when I look at the child i carried i still thank God she lived thought the last 13 years of her life.  \n\nI spent the first 9 months trying to figure out how to get rid of this child, and since have spent the last 12 years 3 months trying to figure out how to save her from the tormoils of the world.  \n\nTeenage years here we come.  Take this as a blessing and move on.  See a doctor, take care and always believe that the Lord will bring you through what ever you need.\nI often screamed at God telling him that he has forgoten me, does not realize that i am unable to deal with that which he has given me.  Then i look at my childs eyes and realize.  NOt only did he give me a way to work through the rape, he gave me the most amazing gift any one can have.  A child who loves me for me.  \n\nGood luck and feel free to email me.",this text is about education and reference,1,yahootopics,Education & Reference,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

"Question: Heart attack; what are my chances of dieing of a heart attack when i grow up? im 16, my father past away feb. 23rd 2006 of a amssive heart attack and my grandma died of a massive heart attack, both on my dad's side...is there any chance i will also have a bad heart when i grow up? i already have medical problems...i have a sleep apnea, a spinal cord problem and many alergies to different things, but most of those don't matter, im just very afraid of having a bad heart....could someone help me possibly?

Answer: Dear Bobo:\n\nI think it is very natural to feel worried about a heart attack if one's father has just died of one a couple of months ago. \n\nHere is my answer:\n\nFIRST: You ARE worried; the question is, SHOULD you be worried? \n\nThe answer is more difficult than just statistics. If you want statistics, cardiac risk, i.e. the risk of a heart attack can be easily calculated:\n\nhttp://hp2010.nhlbihin.net/atpiii/calculator.asp\n\nBut as it states, this calculator, which is used nearly universally by physicians, applies only for those age 20 or greater. Why is that? Because the heart is like pump -- like any mechanical thing, be it one's car or one's sneakers, it wears out over time, and the older one is, the more likely one is have one's heart give out. Since 20 year olds rarely die of heart attacks (i.e. unless you do crack, etc), its not possible to calculate the odds for the ""average"" 16 year old.\n\nSECOND: What IS a heart attack? Generally, it implies a blockage of one of the arteries supplying blood to the heart. The heart, like any muscle, or any machine, requires fuel -- in this case, oxygen, which is supplied to it by the piping called coronary arteries. When these get plugged up, like any pipe, what is needed can't get through. When this happens to living tissue, the tissue dies. In the case of the heart, as it is the main (and only) pump supplying blood to the rest of the body, if the damage is servere enough, then the pump (i.e. heart) completely fails, the entire body is starved of oxygen, and one passes away.\n\nWhat, then, makes one more likely to have a heart attack? Many things, such as genetics, i.e. a family history of heart disease. But, from this discription, anything that stresses or clogs the piping (arteries) to the heart -- i.e. causes heart disease, also known as atherosclerosis. Stuff like high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes (sugar in the piping, like sugar-water on the table, is sticky and gums up the works), high cholesterol, obesity (which is often a cause of SLEEP APNEA), all increase one's risk.\n\nGenerally, when a healthy 16 year old walks into a doctor's office asking, am i at risk for a heart attack, the physician will likely wonder why the patient is asking, rather than being worried about the patient actually being at risk.\n\nWhich brings me to YOUR question: ""could somebody help me?"" \n\n-- the answer I think is: please, please consider talking to a counselor at your school; friends, siblings, a hotline, a doctor. You are worried about your mortality; And right after a family member has died, more so. It's natural, but often, it helps to talk about it. \n\nGo ask your doctor this question, and see what she or he has to say. It'll be worth it. As for heart disease, see your doctor regularly over the years, listen to their advice, and . . .\n\nKeep well, keep healthy.\n\n-------\n\nDisclaimers: \n\nIn addition to the disclaimers already stated by Yahoo.com: \n\nNOTE: The information communicated here does not constitute or imply a patient-doctor interaction or relationship; the reader and/or recipient of any ""answer"" agrees to hold the writer harmless from any loss, harm, injury or damage resulting from or arising out of your submission of the question or your use of or reliance on any response thereto.\n\nAs Stated: Yahoo!

"Question: After PRK laser surgery, how long should I expect before returning to work and/or driving.? 

Answer: To be safe, I had each eye done separately. Each surgery took place on a Saturday... The first time, I didn't return to work until Wednesday but, honestly, I could've gone back sooner.  After the second eye, I went back on Tuesday.  \n\nKeep in mind that it isn't as if you won't be able to *see* right away... But you're going to want to rest the first day.  On the second and maybe third days, you could, in theory, be productive -- but there might be some pain and a lot of eye-watering (and some throbbing temples).  I had to wear protective eyewear, too, which would have looked really silly had returned to work right away. :-)\n\nBest of luck! The experience will be life changing! (If you're interested, I kept a blog of the experience/recovery that I'm more than happy to share...

"Question: Should I get a new Macbook Pro even though Im an accounting major? Im an accounting major and Im worried that I wont be able to use it in my field.  but I think the Mac has Microsoft beat in graphics and innovation.

Answer: I'm not biased @ all seeing how I have an old Mac and LOTS of PCs.\nUnless you're going to use a program that ONLY runs on windows, go for a Mac.\n\nIt'll be so much easier to use vs Windows. It'll be very fast and do what you need it too.\n\nAnd if it ONLY runs on windows, if the rumors are true about the next version of the Mac OS (which you'll be able to install if you buy it now) it'll have ""Virtual PC"" inside the OS itself.

"Question: Is there a real aphrodisiac out there or is it all a myth? Spanish Fly, mushrooms, oysters, etc?  Do any of them work?

Answer: There are real ones. Two types. Chemical and non-chemical. \n\nNon-chemcial\nThose who influence mood making a person more likely to be in the mood. A woman dancing for a man for example, a romantic setting for a woman and so on. \n\nBooze is another non-chemical aphradisiac. Many people lose inhibitions when drunk or stoned. It doesn't alter the sex drive, just allows the person to more fully express it and to disreguard potential consequences. \n\nChemical\nThis is still a new area of study so the effects are rather limited. Certain hormones have been proven to greatly enhance the sex drive of people. The drawback is you have to be able to directly apply them to certain body areas or you have to use them for an extended period before the effects happen. There is no pill out yet that you can just take which will suddenly increase sexual interest. For example a woman given low doses of testosterone will see a surge in sexual interest after I believe a week of the therapy. The downside to this is of course it's a temp fix as long term usage of testosterone by woman would cause severe probems. Even a temp overdose would cause havoc in her system. Men see the same rise in sexual appitite but it has different side effects and a more imediate effect.",this text is about business & finance,1,yahootopics,Business & Finance,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

"Question: Is there serious money to be made in penny stocks, and if so how? Also, is there any scams to watch out for?   Thanks

Answer: There can be serious money to be made if you research everything carefully (remember, some of the biggest names on the stockmarket were penny stocks at one point).... however there can also be serious money LOST too.\n\nHere's a typical example of how it COULD work if your lucky, using my Halifax Sharedealer trading account + the shares in my ISP as an example:\nPipex Communications (PXC.L) - I stuck £5 on them in April 2005 when they were valued @ 7.75pence\nWith sharebuilder, that was £3.48 worth of shares, and £1.52 in commission & Stamp Duty. It bagged me 44.897433 shares in them.\n\nNow, imagine you hold onto them shares for bloody ages, so they rise in value to say 50pence a share.\n\n£0.50 x 44.897433 = £22.45 (or £22.4487165 if you don't round that figure up).\n\nThen of course with Penny stocks they don't usually pay out any dividend...... but imagine how much you can earn with that many shares picked up on the cheap once they've matured enough to pay a dividend to re-invest.\n\nLet's say 10pence a share (just to make it easy to work out)\n£0.10 x 44.897433 shares = £4.49 (practically a refund of your initial investment).\n\nBut you've also gotta remember that as there's so many of them for your money... and you've put a fair bit of money on them (and got bloody loads of shares in them as a result), if they go down in value on you, they can give your portfolio's value a right good kicking... so are as risky as trying to get a bj off an Alligator with toothache.",this text is about business & finance,0,yahootopics,Business & Finance,0,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

Answer: Are you seeing results, I have been using probiotics for the last 8 months. I can can tell when I forget to take them within 24 hours, and when I do take them I can eat anything.

"Question: why do shias pray on a stone or a tissue paper!? 

Answer: They base this on some obscure and very weak hadith that says that the Prophet pbuh did this once - which they took to mean this is the only way to pray. But as I said there is much dispute over whether its even true that he did that and no indication whatsoever that this is the only way to pray.\n\nRather we are told that we can pray anywhere on the Earth, that the Earth is a place of worship and we can pray indoors or outdoors, wherever - you don't even need a rug - its juts you and Allah swt nothing and no-one else - do I need a piece of stone before I can communicate to Him? Do we think Allah swt is dependent on a stone? How silly is that!\n\nNot only that the prayer to an onbject is as we know indicative of idol worship and this is what a lot of them now do - they direct their worship to this stone believing it to be a link with Allah swt and that those of us who pray without it are not praying properly and our prayers won't be heard - - this is shirk on their part and a grave sin.\n\nEnough said really!\n\npeace",this text is about entertainment and music,1,yahootopics,Entertainment & Music,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

"Question: how do you get myspace unblocked? 

Answer: This is my new standard format response for myspace users. First, if you had spent more time studying while you were in school, you wouldn’t have to ask questions about myspace. If you spent more time on your homework and less worrying about why so-and-so has more “internet friends” you might be less concerned with the proxy server bypass that will let you use your schools computer for non-school related activities. When you graduate and get a job so you can afford to buy a computer and pay for internet access I guarantee you myspace will be the least of your concerns. Until said time (if you graduate) quit wasting my tax money by studying myspace more than you study your grammar. Yes, it is my tax money that pays for your education. Chances of you being a prep-school/private school kid and not having one-on-one supervision while you update your myspace is about 4 million to 1. If it really is that important that you have to access it during school hours, why even go to school? Ask mommy and daddy if you can stay home tomorrow and flirt with child predators online. I am sure they won’t mind.

Answer: Best to ask your doctor, as individuals vary greatly in terms of healing time. But as a fellow runner, I will say this -- returning to running too quickly and intensely really increases the risk of you getting seriously injured the next time and putting you on the bench for a long time.\n\nIt's best to wait until your ankle feels completely well, no pain or weirdness when you walk around. Then, ease back into the running -- 15 minutes of running; 15 minutes of walking. Gradually build back up to where you were before.

Answer: Is a spoon better than a fork? If it is, should we do away with forks? Consequently, by doing this would we be improving the eating experience? Holy cow, consider what we're putting at 'steak' here ;)\n\nThe moral of the story is logos and slogans serve individual purposes as well as a complementary one. A logo places an image (worth a thousand words yes, but your thousand words may be quite different from mine) of what the brand stands for in our minds. And a slogan puts those thousand words into one memorable line. Together they help you understand the brand promise and reserve a place for the brand identity in your mind. \n\nSo the next time you see the Nike swoosh, consider how conveniently 'just do it' sums up everyone's unspoken 'thousand word' interpretation of it. \n\nThe comparative longevity of either entity is an issue for watercooler debates and advertising research to figure.",this text is about science & mathematics,1,yahootopics,Science & Mathematics,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

The date keeps getting changed because we need a payoff document from CA and they say they are to swamped to send it to us.

For nicer prizes, perhaps companies can donate items for gift baskets - like movie tickets or spa coupons or fancy snacks or gift cards to different local stores. For really high-end prizes, check with car dealerships for cars or travel agents for travel packages.\n\nOnce you have a grand prize or set of prizes, you can price the tickets - perhaps $1 for a chance to win something in the $10-$50 range or upwards of $25 for a chance to win a trip or a car. If you are selling $1 tickets, you can probably get by with just having a cashbox at a booth and a roll of tickets, and just have ""must be present when the number is announced to win"". but for high end prizes, you should probably be able to accept checks, make special custom tickets, and get full contact information for ticket buyers, to let them know if they win.\n\nLocal businesses love to say that they give back to the community, and one way they do that is to donate stuff for community and school groups that raffle off the the stuff for fundraisers. So check with your local businesses - perhaps you might be raffling movie tickets or gift cards for the mall or an iPod or a weekend trip for two to a local resort. make sure you raffle off something that people want. if people aren't interested in your prize, they might not be willing to buy a ticket.\n\ngood luck!",this text is about entertainment and music,1,yahootopics,Entertainment & Music,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

Answer: You can't erase bad credit unless it is wrong. You need to wait for the usual 10 years for bankrupcy and 7 years for all other negative items on your report to drop. In the mean time, you should still use your credit cards, apply for loans, pay them on time and every time, keep your debt ratio low.

Answer: A black hole is a concentration of mass great enough that the force of gravity prevents anything from escaping it except through quantum tunneling behavior (known as Hawking Radiation). The gravitational field is so strong that the escape velocity near it exceeds the speed of light. This implies that nothing, not even light, can escape its gravity, hence the word ""black"". The term ""black hole"" is widespread, even though it does not refer to a hole in the usual sense, but rather a region of space from which nothing can return.",this text is about society & culture,1,yahootopics,Society & Culture,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

America believes strongly that anyone can come here and practice any religion freely without government involvement.  Recently though, this has been true for every religion except Christianity.  There is nothing wrong with having the ten commandments posted outside of government buildings and such, especially since most of us do believe that there is one God, and the ten commandments are a great moral compass (thy shalt not kill is an excellent commandment, don't you think?).",this text is about education and reference,1,yahootopics,Education & Reference,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

Answer: BitTorrent is both the name of a peer-to-peer (P2P) file distribution client application and also the name of the file sharing protocol itself, both of which were created by programmer Bram Cohen. BitTorrent is designed to widely distribute large amounts of data without incurring the corresponding consumption in costly server and bandwidth resources. CacheLogic suggests that BitTorrent traffic accounts for ~35% of all traffic on the Internet,[1] while other sources are skeptical.[2]\n\nThe original BitTorrent application was written in Python and its source code, as of version 4.0, has been released under the BitTorrent Open Source License (a modified version of the Jabber Open Source License).

A man needs to know that a women takes longer to reach orgasm then a man does and women need to have some kind of foreplay to signal to her body that it's time.

"Question: Does the gov't have the right to weigh our children in public schools and tell the parents they are obese? When I was in high school, they weighed us and sent a letter to the parents telling them their children were either at risk of or are obese. Do they think parents don't know? It is nice that the government is trying to help kids and parents get healthy, but isn't there another way to do it? And it isn't just in high schools, they are doing it in Elementaries also. My niece is 10?! No one should  ever tell her she is fat! They are so worried with the appearance of people that they aren't seeing the bigger picture!

Answer: i'm not familiar with how health care works in the United States but in Canada it's the tax dollars that pay for health care.

What's happening here? Well, the vinegar is causing the proteins within the milk to bind together, forming the curds. The substance left over is that watery whey protein.

"Question: What is the history of Herpes? 

Answer: The herpes infection has a history dating back to ancient Greece.  The word 'herpes' was used by Hippocrates to describe lesions that 'creep' or 'crawl.'  Although previously well characterized, it was not until 1893 that the transmissibility was recognized.6\n\nThe herpes family of viruses currently is thought to consist of herpes simplex 1 (HSV-1), herpes simplex 2 (HSV-2), varicella-zoster, Epstein-Barr, cytomegalovirus, and human herpes virus VI, VII, and VIII.5  All are capable of entering and replicating in epithelial cells, while some of the herpes family is neurotropic and others are lymphotropic.  HSV-1 and HSV-2 are neurotropic, infecting sensory nerve fibers and have been demonstrated to reproduce in epithelial cells.  HSV-1 and HSV-2 are lytic to human epithelial cells and latent in neural tissue at the site of regional ganglions.  Usually the virus initially enters the body through a break in the mucous membrane integrity, although there is evidence that it may penetrate intact skin.  In either case, transmission results from mucocutaneous contact with infected secretions and aerosols.  When reactivated, the virus travels along the nerve axon to the surface epithelial cells and can cause a recurrent epithelial outbreak.\n\nOften the initial herpes infection goes undetected.  However, in a small percentage of cases, the initial oral infection with HSV-1 or HSV-2 is acutely symptomatic causing many signs and symptoms detected by the patient.  When the patient demonstrates systemic signs, symptoms, and has perioral and intraoral vesicular lesions, it is referred to as primary herpetic gingivostomatitis.  Although the condition most often occurs in children, it can also affect adolescents and adults.  Fever and lymphadenopathy may occur, lasting from 2-10 days.  Pharyngitis, malaise, myalgia, fiery red gingival, and mucosal tissues associated with painful swallowing are hallmarks of the primary infection.  Intraorally, many small punctate ulcers may form on keratinized and nonkeratinized mucosa as well as at the nasopharynx.  Perioral tissues can also be affected.\nhttp://www.thejcdp.com/issue009/tilliss/10tillis.htm",this text is about politics & government,1,yahootopics,Politics & Government,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

"Question: What are nicknames for different eras? (ex: Age of Enlightenment)? This is probably weird, but I'm doing a project on what the Medieval Era could be called (Age of Faith, etc) and need some other era's nicknames for the introduction. :] Thanks in advance.

Answer: Actually, the Medieval Era is usually referred to as the Dark Ages. Because of the stranglehold that supersition had on people. Anything connecting with science and the arts was considered evil, in fact a person would be killed if he/she defied the held order of the day. When people actually managed to break free of this, was the era that is called the Renaissance, which referred to the rebirth of knowledge.",this text is about family & relationships,1,yahootopics,Family & Relationships,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

"Question: Can I trade my American citizenship with someone who wants to immigrate to the USA? I have tons of education (2 masters degrees, and I am almost finished with a PhD)--I could work or teach in most any country in the world.  The difficult part is finding a work visa in another country--just like immigrants coming here to the USA.  \n\nCan't we just work out a trade of some sort?

Answer: I understand your sentiments.  I myself am an American finishing up a PhD in England.  Alas, you cannot trade your own citizenship.  Citizenship is, for the most part, an inalienable right.  While the US government has in the past attempted to revoke the citizenship rights of certain parties convicted of treason, the Supreme Court has actually ruled such actions as unconstitutional as 'Cruel and Unusual Punishment'.\n\nMy suggestion to you, if you are set on moving to and working in a specific country, would be to do a 'dry-run' so to speak.  If you know that country's immigration rules you probably already know that you can move there temporarily to look for work, usually for a period of 3 to 6 months.  In many countries, such as Britain, once you're in the country it is much easier to find work there.  Once you've found work get a temporary work visa.  In many countries, again, like Britain, once you've lived in country for 1 year you are eligible to go through the naturalization process.  You can be naturalized in any country in the world, you just have to be willing to go through the beauracratic processes to reach that point.  They may seem daunting, but if you're set on moving to and staying in a different country, there is no reason to hesitate to seek naturalization.",this text is about entertainment and music,1,yahootopics,Entertainment & Music,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20

"Question: Why is Irridium a part of the platinum family? 

Answer: The periodic table is divided into sections by chemists in order to make it easier to talk about elements that behave in similar fashions.  The periodic table makes this possible by organizing elements by the number of electrons in each orbital.  The transition metals, the family that platinum and Iridium both belong in, is made up of elements that in their elemental (as opposed to compound) form have a d orbitals as their last filled orbital.  This gives them some similar properties and ways in which they will react.  Which is why scientists call them families.",this text is about business & finance,1,yahootopics,Business & Finance,1,gpt-4o-2024-11-20
